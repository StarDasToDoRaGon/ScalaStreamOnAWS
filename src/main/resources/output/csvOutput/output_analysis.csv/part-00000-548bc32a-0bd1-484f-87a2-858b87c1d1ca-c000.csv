4. It is essential to underscore the importance of Illinois law,1
Citi has claimed that I am responsible for these charges because the thief used my PIN in making the purchases. They have cited a portion of the card agreement which states,1

My complaint is that they charged me the annual fee and then dramatically changed the dynamic of the card. I would never pay over {$1000.00} in annual fees for a card with a pre-set limit. It's embarrassing having your card decline at a store you frequent for your business and it's sets the wrong precedence about you as a business owner. If AE wants to add a pre-set spending limit,1

I called XXXX who gave me the number to the XXXX department and talked with the manager. She told me it was the credit companys fault. They couldnt do anything about it. I explained to her,0
request you to please help me with this issue and this is causing me unnecessary harassment.,0
I am uploading proof that my account has never been late and their practice are straight garbage. The company is synchrony I have several cards with them but only one left to pay off. I think they get very upset that I always pay off before interest occurs.,0

I was advised by Capital One Financial on XX/XX/2023 to file an active dispute regarding a purchase to be made later that same day. I called Capital One inquiring on refund protection. The reason I called is because I had suspected that an issue may/could potentially arise from the merchant,0
The issue is that this was my second attempt to apply for the card and this was their second excuse.,0
I made XXXX attempts to pay the card off in the following weeks but was told by phone it was too early to make a payment. When the billing statement arrived in the mail I made another attempt to pay off the card from my checking account... but I kept receiving notifications that the payment was rejected. I called my bank and they explained I was using the wrong routing number. I immediately corrected the problem and made a payment in full several weeks before the due date. I was notified by synchrony bank that my account had been closed due to DISHONORED payments.

As a loyal Discover Card customer,0
I request your agencies to investigate this matter a second time. My next step is the Department of Justice.,0
On Saturday XX/XX/XXXX it was pouring rain and I found myself stuck at home all day expecting the package to be returned to me. The US Post Office threw it on the street by my apartment building outside door under the heavy rain : they did not call nor rang the buzzer but left it under the pouring rain and without any consideration for everything they made me go through for an insignificant overseas shipping.,0
Thus,0
I am left with no choice but to request the immediate processing of the {$11000.00} refund to my US Bank credit card account. This refund is essential to rectify the financial burden caused by this incident. I expect this matter to be resolved without further delay.,0

"*The vendor has a \\\" Refund at first scan '' policy which I was expecting to avail myself of.",0
Long story short 1. I need them to send the card via the mailing method I gave them.,0

I have not made or authorized these charges I can not get to speak to a live person to tell me what makes them think this is not fraud as I know it is.,0

I at times had thousands of dollars of credit balance for overpayment.,0
They don't think this happened,0

Iget paid on the first of every month and I pay my bills then. I also get paid on forth Wednesday of the month.,0
This practice is wrong in so many ways. They are getting there money every month on time or a day or two early and I get charged for this.,0
Asking for them to rectify the situation. They told me to write this letter to their very own credit repair department. Which will take all together 30+ days. I was shocked that he wanted to sit their and read this to me after he verified on a recorded line that that paid me after the reimbursement arrived on my account. Informing me that they have no way of knowing the funds were returned???,0
I will also follow up with an invoice for said violations ( {$1000.00} per violation ).,0
Again bank blocks my account and this time blocks my online banking.,0
I called again & spoke with another rep who told me the same story and again I stated that there was nothing in my dashboard and asked to be connected to a supervisor.,0
The problem is that Bank of America uses the credit limit of {$32000.00} as opposed to the balance in the account and credit limit. This is fraud that has been perpetrated on me and hundreds of others.,0
I will require an explanation as to why the letter from Capital One was sent and received after their prescribed deadline. And what specifically is Capital One requesting or better worded what was specifically missing in the written and signed statement letter.,0

4. Original copy of the Note and Mortgage deed as they are not to be separated at anytime. I need them both as they are mine.,0
XX/XX/XXXX : I logged into my account and noticed this fraudulent transaction notified barclays via customer service,0
2. In XX/XX/2023,0
1. Customer service reps should communicate the need to add additional money to a pay off amount and educate customers when they ask for a pay off amount. Otherwise,0
XXXX also told that my card was blocked at XXXX XXXX since I used XXXX XXXX instead of the physical card,0
I tried reaching out to the original company XXXX XXXX but they refused to refund me or provide me a hotel room.,0
TO THAT POINT,0
We then came to the counter to pay them in Cash for the amount of XXXX XXXX which is {$31000.00} USD and XXXX XXXX which is {$610.00} USD. I paid XXXX XXXX in cash even as XXXX dont have denomination of XXXX cent and we did not have the cent so we rounded up. We was supposed to pay only XXXX XXXX.

I have previously requested that they reissue past rewards that have not expired ( 90 days from the date of issue ) and that have not been redeemed. I dont know what the result was because I have not been able to get that information from AAFES XXXX,0
I have now have had multiple run-ins with this financial institution the first being in how they are still charging me overdraft fees and the amounts of which I was being charged these fees to now telling me that I didn't understand what fraud was and they would not be reaching out to the merchant to justify the sleight of hand that I was dealing with. I don't know when Banks decided they were going to be judging jury when dealing with people 's finances there are specific avenues available to people with credit cards that allow you to be protected. For my bank to tell me that I could not exercise those avenues to protect myself I feel is unjust.,0
Later that day at XXXX,0

"I called Chase customer service on XXXX to report the issue. Chase sent a letter on XXXX saying they \\\" researched the purchases '' and decided that \\\" the charges are not categorized as the XXXX property ''",0
If this is only for the purpose of verifying my identity,0
My concern and complaint is that due to no fault of my own this closure of the comenity.net credit card is going to have a negative impact upon my credit history as the comenity.net credit card is my longest standing credit card with several years of positive history. Additionally if I activate the new bread rewards card on XX/XX/XXXX it will reflect on my credit the new account and I will lose all of the positive history that I previously worked very hard for.,0

At this point ( over 70 days ) i don't know who is at fault.Although XXXX sent me an email after i filed a claim that they returned the money to Chase.,0
Negative Credit Impact : This reporting affects the customer 's credit report and potentially lowers their credit score,0
Reasons were : Length of credit history ( I have had credit card with Citi/Home Depot alone for 3 years ) Payment pattern on account,0
Unresponsiveness to Redress : Multiple attempts to contact XXXX and resolve these issues proved futile. This unresponsiveness reveals a clear absence of a redress mechanism,0

15. Presently available details of the above actions of Citi bank/Best Buy have been submitted in this complaint. However,0
This is so far beyond outside the scope of any person let alone any business to be doing if they do not know me. It is unprofessional and it is unacceptable for any reason whatsoever.,0
Here 's a full breakdown of how I paid off my entire balance within three months : In XXXX of XXXX,0
If I was to wire {$250.00},0
The current balance with interest charges and late fees is now {$12000.00}. Copy enclosed.,0
Below is the letter I sent to Chase. There has been no resolution and Chase continues to assert we are responsible for this charge even though the product paid for was never delivered.,0
The last representative that I spoke to in the XXXX XXXX escalation line was rude and combative and should be transferred out of that role.,0

( Please reference Exhibit XXXX ) On XXXX,0
I want them to listen to the 2 phone calls I had with their associates : The first one in which I asked if I would be charged again and the second one in which their associate treated me aggressively and with discrimination.,0
I believe that my concerns and requests have been handled in a manner that is not only dismissive but also discriminatory. This has left me with the disturbing feeling that my treatment may be based on my race,0
I am very disappointed with the way that Bank of America has handled this situation. I have been a loyal customer for many years,0
Citi asked me to confirm that the card was in our ( me and my wife ) possession.,0
4 ) Chase needs to take complete responsibility and contact the three merchants listed above to insure they received the money that Chase claims they returned. That will allow those merchants to refund {$1000.00} owed me. It wasnt my mistake and I shouldnt have been the one to prove to the above merchants that Chase returned their money ; though I tried numerous times.,0

I've also attached a screenshot from Credit strong where I make 10x the payment to them each month that grow credit says I don't have in my bank account.,0
2. ) I booked an American Airlines ticket as well.,0
I received a call XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  stating payment had not been received. I was moving that day and did not have access to my info.,0
I have attempted to resolve this issue directly with Wells Fargo,0

Yup yup 33 minutes ago Agent profile picture Discover I definitely understand and what is the dispute amount and date?,0
After going through multiple rounds of contact with American Express,0
XXXX email notice came in with late and interest charges {$52.00} charge was paid that same day.,0
I suspect they want me to hold a balance so that they may charge me interest. Which should be a civil offense that should garner legal action. It is a morally corrupt system they have in place and I would have to deal with this for at least 6 months according to them before they can approve my payments any faster.,0
I have not activated this card.,0
All the details/documents for these disputes were provided to Capital One in XXXX and XXXX. We have paid all legitimate charges that we made to our account in full to Capital One. Yet they did not remove disputed fraudulent charges from our account,0
Discover : You are not able to make a payment towards your principal balance.,0
The distressing part is this. I applied for credit to get interest free payments for 1 year through Synchrony Bank. My Credit was approved for {$10000.00}. The sales lady ( XXXX XXXX? ) then used the credit card number to make the purchase. She kept having trouble with the credit terminal and kept repeating the charge saying it was not going through. I asked her Are you sure you are not charging me 3x for the same machine? Her reply was no she was not because she was not getting a receipt of sale from the terminal.,0
The travel agent told me that one of the 3 rooms payments for approximately {$29000.00} was cancelled by the Credit Card Company even though I had the full balance in my account less the approximately {$5000.00} applied to my credit card bill which I did not authorize. In any case,0
I have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars and paid thousands of dollars in both annual fees and merchant transaction fees,0
Capital One then requested a signed letter including a statement which was sent then received. The letter requested a written deadline of XX/XX/2023 This is not possible due to the fact the letter was received and sent after the deadline after XX/XX/2023. ( Please refer to attachment circled sections : letter dated XX/XX/2023 ) I provided in the statement letter all the information requested including the name of merchant transaction amount and date with the case number. And was told that the letter was received after the deadline and the letter lacks all the information previously requested. Capital One then denied the claim.,0
The payments never transfered showing no payments were made ; though every month showing I upped the payment by XXXX to cover last month 's fake late fees.,0

I was instantly approved by Avant for the new credit card and at the exact moment ( instantly ) that I received a confirmation email for said approval,0

"We consider this a \\\" predatory practice '' by Wells Fargo ( and others ). It is designed to hope borrowers forget the date upon which they have to pay the balance and have an immense amount of interest charged to them.

American Express is alleging that a customer can not rely on the instructions they provide by phone.,0
What I want now from Bank of America is not the credit card anymore,0
The charge was disputed,0
Then XXXX responded to Discover with what appeared to be an illegible written note. Discover ruled in my favor. Then about 3 weeks later I checked the dispute and Discover ruled in the merchant 's favor and they refused to talk to me or provide any evidence.,0
The only document that was sent to me in writing was the 'Credit Card Account Agreement'- Terms for the lending agreement.,0
To make matters worse,0

So I checked my bank account and realized that Target did not withdraw the {$11.00} from my account on due date,0
I want to know when my credit union decided that it was going to be my judge jury and executioner on my claim that I was being frauded by a specific merchant. I have a bank account with a bank to make sure that I am protected at all times from companies that are out to do wrong. I was then told that there was only one way that there could be fraud and that was if somebody stole my identity and used my cards against my will. I know for a fact that fraud is when somebody is offering something service product or anything else that is not up to the standard that they are offering it at. I continue to argue back and forth with the representative at my bank who was not willing to listen or hear me out on why I thought that it should move forward and was told because I had mistakenly placed it as a dispute not fraud from the beginning that it could not be changed. When did it become okay for my bank to tell me that due process to protect me would not be available.,0
I am not currently in the US. While I was away from home traveling,0
On my XXXX statement it included the amount of {$10000.00} as the XXXX XXXX XXXX. The Payment due date is XX/XX/XXXX. I paid {$11000.00} on XX/XX/XXXX.,0

I filed a dispute with my credit card company ( Discover ). They denied my dispute before I was even able to get a copy of the police report. The report just became available and I uploaded it. I was unable to upload the bodycam footage through the dispute portal. Discover is refusing to issue a refund despite all of the evidence provided including the new evidence.

You will need : A valid state-issued ID or government-issued drivers license. A cell phone or tablet that can receive text messages and take pictures.,0
The problem is that United 's process does not involve either of those things. United instructed me to file a claim over the phone which then redirected me to their text-message based customer service system. It is via their text-message-based system that my claim for damages was filed,0
I called the bank customer service and asked if that amount would be charged again and the associate I spoke with said it wouldn't because she could not see anything to be charged on her system and I would have to reschedule a new payment manually.,0

The first attempted call I was given no information. I was told my voice sounded robotic and asked to turn off my speaker phone.

XXXX : Called the number again and the representative told me I had the wrong department ( been the same phone number everytime I called.

American Express sent me correspondence stating a credit was issued but it never was. I tried the rectify the issue multiple times with their customer service representatives to no avail. I reached out to CFPB which triggered an internal AMEX investigation. Whereby,0

We have not heard from you. Do you wish to continue to chat?,0
They confirmed who I am based on all pertinent data with date of birth,0
Reflecting on the Past : Earlier grievances seem to have been prematurely archived without directly addressing the pivotal matters. Such oversight nudges us to take this intensified approach.,0
I must emphasize my disappointment with the lack of communication from the institution throughout this ordeal. I have yet to receive any notifications via email regarding the status of my credit card delivery or the resolution of the fraudulent charges. Such notifications are fundamental to a professional and reliable banking service.,0

I guess somebody who stole my personal information might apply credit card.,0
Then another charge to XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX for {$33.00} credit card company paid the seller once but charged me twice. Admitted again they did it but claim to not know how to fix it.,0
Kind Regards,0
Due to a policy at Citi Bank,0
All of these matters seem to be a result of Synchrony not being able to find a bank 's routing number and then taking a week to say so- so that they can try to charge customers interest and apply whatever other punishments they think that they can get away with.,0
Upon contacting TJ Maxx,0
"I went ahead and issued another check through XXXX XXXX XXXX for {$300.00} and am awaiting my \\\" refund / overage. '' My beef about all of this is two-fold.",0
During the call I expressed my concern about the restriction placed on my Capital One account. First they stated it was a fraud alert on the account that I was 1 never made aware of and two I never had anything fraudulent occur during the time these accounts have been open.,0
Customer Service Interaction : At present,0
The letter I received this evening from Capital One contains none of the required information regarding which bureaus they pulled despite the fact that the letter says that they are listed on the reverse side. There is nothing on the reverse side other than an Equal Credit Opportunity Act disclaimer.,0
They refused to compensate me for the transportation costs and refused to unlock the account despite their acknowledgment that my account has no issues.,0
This has caused a tremendous amount of stress,0
This discrepancy arose from what I believe was inadequate clarification and transparency in the marketing of Best Buy 's credit card offer. Unlike previous experiences with other retailers,0
We contacted the Chase fraud department to alert them of the purchase,0
To our huge surprise on XX/XX/2023 we received a letter from Chase in which they stated that they considered the disputed US {$6900.00} charge as valid because it matched the receipt provided by XXXX That fabricated receipt was however the very problem what this dispute was about!,0

Charge Back Initiation : I initiated a charge back due to my belief that the product was not as advertised.,0
I appreciate your attention to this matter and your assistance in resolving this issue. Please do not hesitate to contact me if further information is required.,0
Paragraph 3 of the anonymous response states in essence that the merchant states I returned only three cases. That is correct in part but only because the merchant failed to honor its commitment to accept the return. Only three cases were returned BECAUSE THE MERCHANT REFUSED TO ACCEPT THE CASE THAT ARRIVED AT MY HOME DAMAGED.,0
I'll need to try another verification method for this.,0
XX/XX/XXXX - Provisional dispute was reversed for the 3rd time - challenged again XX/XX/XXXX - Provisional dispute was to be applied again.,0

The supervisor could not find any information in the notes stating any other reason why the accounts could have been closed after telling the supervisor I wanted to file a complaint on the employee that I had spoken to because that employee had intentionally flagged my accounts to be closed for no apparent reason as I was trying to inquire on lower APRs. I advised the supervisor why I would make payments a few days prior and have my accounts closed,0
XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX day ) Spoke with XXXX ( Supervisor ) and was told again the investigation was still on-going ; case has been escalated for resolution.,0

Please advise as soon as possible! Thank you!,0
This estimate prominently featured XXXX 's branding at the top page and nowhere was it prominently mentioned that they are acting as a broker until the middle of the multi page contract and this was not highlighted so at the time since I did not read it carefully I was totally unware that this business was in fact not an actual moving company.,0
A fraud report was made by me to Chase. They claimed to have investigated and determined that all charges were legitimate. I asked them to reopen the investigation which they did and they came to the same conclusion. I then contacted XXXX and asked them to investigate one of the charges selected at random. They determined that the selected charge was indeed fraud made by someone else using another account shipping the product to another location ( see attached email from XXXX ). I asked Chase to reopen the investigation in light of this new information from XXXX. They reinvestigated and determined that the charge was legitimate.,0
I Never requested access ; I did request proof of no access and XXXX XXXX refused to give it to me. I am not using or accessing the system and I will never use it,0
In another part of the letter it says. I NEED TO CONTACT THE MERCHANT DIRECTLY OR BY OTHER MEANS TO OBTAIN CREDIT.,0

They gave me the runaround and so did a supervisor who said it would take SIX DAYS for my account to reflect the payments. Now this was a Thursday before a weekend and they were telling me my payments made all the way back to XX/XX/XXXX would not be reflected until the following Tuesday or Wednesday on XX/XX/XXXX or XXXX. And they were right. My available credit and spending amount were updated almost a full week after calling them and over a week since my payments were taken out of my checking account.,0
I don't have any sort of proof as to the time of this writing - that the transaction was indeed EMV-based.,0

I attempted to call again about the same issue. I was transferred to a couple people before I got to XXXX ( I am not sure if this was her name ). XXXX told me that I would have to contact the merchant and have them agree to refund me. I explained that I had contacted the merchant before even filing the dispute. What she was saying to me made no sense. I explained that I had information to support my case but you closed my case and ruled in the merchant 's favor without asking for it or considering it. She was unable to respond to why my information wasn't being considered. After going around in circles with her I asked to speak to a supervisor. She said one wasn't available and she could have someone contact me in 48 hours. I asked her name and she disconnected the call. This is why I am not sure of her name.,0
They told me to submit another statement and highlighted the contract part saying that retouch should be provided.,0

If theres a delay shipping your order,0
I fulfilled all the conditions listed and yet did not receive the discount.,0
Later in the afternoon,0
Fraud refusing to tell me why my account was blocked telling me no one is allowed to talk to me until I go to the bank.,0
Citi is engaging in predatory lending and account review practices and I believe it is high time for this agency and any other relevant agencies to take action. They will not hurt me significantly for now since I have no intention of seeking credit for major purchases or additional travel. I had no intention of publicly complaining about them until they retaliated against me but I will complain loudly and frequently to anyone willing to listen.,0
This company is notorious for issues with their rewards,0
I received no communication from American Express in XXXX and in XXXX I was notified that my payment was past due.,0

On XXXX I called Chase customer service to acquire in the stated promotion and was told that Chase has the right to change the promotional offer at will. This is a classic bait and switch. Again,0
The Fair Credit Billing Act ( FCBA ) requires PayPal Credit to investigate a dispute thoroughly. But they failed to do so and continued to make a decision consistent with a description of discrimination. They also could not establish a factual obligation that requires me to pay them.,0
As is my right when an airline cancels a flight for their internal reasons,0
Chase bank shouldnt be targeting children to begin with. Then theyre purposefully blurring the disclaimer to hide facts from what should be public knowledge.,0

When I contacted my bank the next morning or afternoon I'm not sure when I contacted them exactly. I got another very pleasant person on the phone they proceeded to complete the dispute and my dispute was flagged in their system and I was told my dispute was under investigation. When did I become the target in an investigation when I am turning to my bank to help protect me from an institution that was falsely offering services that were not being met. I was then told that my dispute was not valid and therefore would not be granted.,0
I then sent them a letter ( basic claim ) of instructions on XX/XX/2023 informing them about the laws the broke ( Adverse action 15 USC 1691c ) Then on XX/XX/2023 they sent another letter denying me which is illegal.,0
It seems as if nobody knows exactly who handles what,0
XXXX said she has no financial loss. XXXX will sign complaints if the unknown offender is identified.,0
I tried to go to the merchant which is a huge company and the clerks do not have the power to help me since they already processed the refund on their end. Additionally the merchant later on states that I return too many items and they do not want to help me further to get the money back from Amex. They are not required to accept my return but they ARE required to refund me in the event that they do accept the return as in this case so where is my money.,0

5 ) I do have a chase account with benefits. Because Good Year Credit card application is mainly a website application rather than offer perks of phone app application that I believe Good Year is recognizing benefits are similar and does not want to provide a credit card where my credit score is good and I have been paying off all credit card debt responsibly thus good year credit card perks are for 6 months deferral of payment thus I believe it is discriminatory to recognize credit card debt as if I am not paying this off correctly as to have a good credit score with the debt obligation thus good year does not want to supply credit card perks of payment deferral because I might be receiving perks on the other credit car which I am successfully paying off thus wrongfully assumes I do not deserve this credit card and perks until I paid off the full debt which is discriminatory in-nature because credit cards compete on XXXX XXXX and that if I have been receiving XXXX XXXX for quite some time that thus credit card application exploits this perk as if I have not been accruing income or have a higher net worth to pay off the debt thus XXXX XXXX is a discriminatory factor among obtaining new credit cards because good year allows 6 month deferral at the XXXX XXXX rate essentially such I would have the ability to pay off debt per my income and net worth or cash readily available as part of my net worth. XXXX XXXX credit card applications thus are discriminatory to recognize any debt obligations are per other perks of credit card which does not showcase that I am unable to pay the credit card correctly but only showcases that payment is not due immediately thus a debt obligation on a XXXX XXXX credit card is discriminatory because I do not have an obligation to pay immediately thus good will would accrue because I was accepted by a competition credit card company to allow XXXX XXXX for longer than XXXX year thus compared to a year of XXXX XXXX that any obligation is quite low but I did not see any specifics noted on these denial thus is discriminatory because good will is achieved by have XXXX XXXX and good credit score as to pay only a required monthly payment. Thus good year discriminates against those who have good credit and good credit terms of XXXX XXXX because a debt obligation does not exist as if I need to pay immediately as to be in jeopardy but is a sign of good will that I am paying off the debt correctly with a XXXX XXXX credit card and that if a XXXX XXXX is ending that it would be appropriate to try good year at their XXXX XXXX and recognize my debt obligation with the previous credit card will be cleared once payment is required to be made after the XXXX XXXX ends per the credit agreement. Thus good year is discriminatory as to showcase a generic credit card application as to entrap their victims with a 6 month XXXX XXXX but fail to recognize the debt obligation is essentially covered and is not a concern for poor credit but excellent credit because the terms allows XXXX XXXX to exist thus without a required payment necessary that debt obligation does not truly exist as if I am missing any payments or paying late. I believed this was an I correct denial to boost their credit reputation against competition thus perks should only be received at XXXX credit card line rather than recognizing that I can transfer to a XXXX XXXX credit card upon a XXXX credit XXXX credit card ending. The former credit card did not allow a renewal of XXXX XXXX thus I can transfer to a new credit card without worry about credit card obligation because the due date shows that I am not required to pay but I am continuously paying off the credit card either way. The denial was too simple and discriminatory as a concern for a generic application to only allow XXXX XXXX for those who do not already have XXXX XXXX as to showcase no debt in most cases owed to a credit card which is also anticompetitive because XXXX XXXX is a staple or marketing ploy that allows a person to sign up but can essentially take on a new credit card upon XXXX XXXX ending even though debt is still not obligated to be paid in full as to transfer to a new credit card without need to transfer debt to the new credit card. Thus a Chase credit card allows a long term XXXX XXXX thus good year will void credit card applications incorrectly as to show bad will upon other competitors offering XXXX XXXX as well and that the debt obligation is not truly owed until payment is due thus credit score is still good which was clearly not reflected with the debt of this credit card that this is good debt not bad debt regardless of how much debt a person has because the debt does not exist until it is required to be paid thus monthly debt is nit required by the chase credit card on a XXXX XXXX plan thus I should not be having bad will or bad faith understandings if good year is exploiting the XXXX XXXX understanding as to require me to pay off the debt in full before receiving a new credit card with the previous credit card company. Discriminatory in nature because it is responsible to sign up for XXXX XXXX thus debt is not accounted for correctly if debt obligations are still under a XXXX XXXX plan where the monthly requirement is not an obligation at all and thus should not be a detriment to my credit quality or score as to not be required to pay and any insinuations of having to pay off the debt before receiving a new credit card for like XXXX XXXX terms is discriminatory in nature as XXXX XXXX is exploited to deny credit card applications wrongfully.,0

3 ) Based on the application that this is generic in nature. If denied I should be able to appeal as to showcase the net worth of myself as to show that I have the ability to pay. Lack of net worth is discriminatory in-nature because it relies on income rather than recognize a person could have received a lump sum payment for government assistance or already has money saved thus has the ability to pay. Income is discriminatory in nature because the application is generic such does not recognize where the income is derived from as more secure than income received from an employer if received from the federal government and also one can not be considered unemployed if receiving certain type of benefits from the government. Thus these factors were not weighed as discriminatory to provide generic income understandings on the application not pegged to a certain reason of where the income is coming from.,0

That is,0
. Customer service and supervisors seem to like to blame systematics on the neglect and lack of proper XXXX XXXX over providing customers with proper help when dealing with their financial info,0

Bank of America credited my card for the {$250.00} temporarily ( see attachment XXXX ). It should be noted that in the upper right corner of the document,0
When I returned to drop the car off the following day I asked the attendant to check us in. He said that we were good to go and kept directing traffic. We took a video and left.,0
I have found many published articles one that struck me interesting is by an underwriter to a bank who noticed Chase Amazon Amazon themself create a conundrum for their clients pretty much in the same situation that I'm dealing with more so on the interest fee and charges aspect from Chase but Amazon as well with the loopholes that they have and continuing to charge people even after they've requested cancellation and gone through the motions for cancellation of XXXX.,0
PNC emailing me monthly that my card statement is available online. As alternative to solve the issue I asked PNC to switch my statements from online to regular paper so I receive them in mail,0
When I contacted the merchant.They repeatedly said they sent a refund to my bank but it appears Chase will not credit the funds to my account because they don't know how after a dispute is closed.,0
WHEN I COMPLETED THE APPLICATION I WAS IMMEDIATELY APPROVED AND ADDED MY MOTHER AS AN AUTHORIZED USER SO SHE COULD HELP ME EARN THESE POINTS FASTER BY USING THE CARD AS WELL AND PAYING IT OFF AS QUICK AS POSSIBLE.,0
Since I was blind sided by my bank XXXX XXXX XXXX randomly shutting my accounts down without explanation or a proper heads up,0
Next billing cycle,0
The video I linked to shows proof of them stating one thing,0
The idea that my identity is unverified is absurd.,0
I received the statement in the mail -- the one that the woman was seeing online. Yet,0
XX/XX/2023 - I received a letter from Gemini Customer Support Dispute Resolution that mirrored the one received on XX/XX/2023 but why the decided against me was different. This letter stated that based on their investigation of relevant information,0
We're beyond that,0
This is an unacceptable level of service. I use the BofA online payment system to make payments using the BofA epay system which lets me set up payments days,0
I want my credit score corrected.,0
"After submitting the \\\" eBill Request ''",0
On XXXX I received a second letter asking me to sign a form to report the charges as unauthorized and issue a new card. I returned this form on XXXX by Postal Mail.,0

"Now they're forcing me to pay for a transaction that I never authorized due to the simple fact that \\\" A statement and payments were made to the account ''. I never looked at my statements and lost track of my finances and when I found out my account was past due and at risk of closure I immediately paid the account no questions asked which I then later reviewed and called in the fraud department to investigate and inquire about this",0
The welcome email from Raymour and Flanagan does not give me any information about my new account,0
Do you recognize these transactions?,0
XXXX ONLY REFUNDED TO AFFIRM {$130.00}. AFFIRM SAID I OWED THEM {$31.00}.,0

I have an XXXX business and I often use XXXX so I told them it was me and to please approve the purchases as I was at dinner with a potential client and investor trying to pay my bill and was embarrassed that my card kept declining.,0
I learned that American Express had charged my closed account with a membership fee ( which is now reversed ) and the past due charges were two late fees on an account that was paid off pursuant to information that American Express provided and that account was canceled.,0
I have several pressing concerns that demand immediate attention : Failure to Receive Services : I have not received the hotel room for which I was charged,0
- From XX/XX/2023 through XX/XX/2023 I traveled to XXXX.,0

Come Monday this what Capital One and I did first thing in the morning.,0
Wayfair Credit Card (issued by Citibank,0
I have asked multiple representatives to identify the specific fraudulent activity on the account,0
What I did not know at the time until I was trying to do my taxes with my accountant is that someone had stolen my card number and had made {$18000.00} worth of purchases at XXXX. Which was definitely not me.,0
Their decison to close my account because I earned my rewards was to attempt to try and prevent the rewards from being used,0
Citibank offered a Balance Transfer offer of XXXX XXXX XXXX expiring XX/XX/XXXX On XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  I took advantage of this offer and made a Balance Transfer of {$5200.00} + 5 % one time fees of {$260.00} My intention was to pay off the Promotional transactions in their entirety before the expiration date ( XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  ),0
I am the Primary Card Holder ( PCH ). XXXX XXXX was the Authorized User ( AU ) on the Chase Sapphire Card ( XXXX,0
We have had extensive conversations with the XXXX support team where they have acknowledged that our accounts were in fact accessed by someone unknown and they were using our credit card that was tied to the account. It took XXXX almost a month to remove the unknown,0
Fortunately,0
XX/XX/XXXX : fraudulent charge at XXXX on my Barclay arrivals card in amount of {$160.00}.,0
XXXX watched for the refund and after several weeks still didn't ' have it. I tracked the progress,0
For that reason,0
I tried,0
Not wanting to interact with the police. I decided to leave and they told me that I had a warranty. I believe it was 30 or 60 days and that they would freely make adjustments doing the warranty period.,0
I mentioned to them that they were unable to do the proper adjustments while I was at their office so it was useless for me to come back because they may once again offer to call the police to have me trespassed.,0
Throughout my time as a customer,0
When I did not see the points after meeting above conditions,0
Ive tried to call corporate the office on the letter on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  which I researched and was denied access and told that such a department didnt exist and transferred to Personal Loans ( XXXX ) and XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Arizona from the credit card department told me I was only able to be sent to the Security Team .,0
XX/XX/2023 I paid comenity express IN FULL {$140.00} XX/XX/2023 comenity express charged me interest of {$2.00} XX/XX/2023 comenity express charged me a late fee of {$2.00} XX/XX/2023 comenity express charged me a minimum interest charge of {$2.00} XX/XX/2023 comenity express charged me a minimum interest charge of {$2.00} XX/XX/2023 I paid {$9.00} and requested the company stop charging me interest and fees on a balance I paid off months ago.,0
That same day,0
When I tried to make payment to XXXX XXXX XXXX in all increments,0
I also wish to point out that Chase recently took actions against individuals such as XXXX XXXX,0
I had been told by Discover customer service for subscriptions at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX days ago to obtain documentation. I was told that they had no record of the charge at all. I also spoke to a supervisor at XXXX XXXX. I reiterated the same thing. She had no record of a {$99.00} charge. I asked her for documentation. She advised her name was XXXX and the confirmation No. of this conversation is XXXX. As there was no record of the origin of the charge she suggested I talk to Discover since Discover reversed the charge.,0
Then I went to XXXX XXXX to make the purchase again. Physically this time,0
I paid in full my XX/XX/2023 balance ( {$1800.00} ). For my XX/XX/2023 statement,0
A month goes by without an email/phone call piece of mail nothing. So I reach out to XXXX XXXX for an update. Spoke to a The fraud dept he said they are still investigating,0
I made a {$2500.00} payment on XX/XX/XXXX,0
I will try once again and hopefully this will be directed to someone more fluent in XXXX.,0
When I call that number after going through all the prompts the automated system tells me the wait is more than 20 minutes. I don't have 20 minutes. I have no other way to communicate with Capital One.,0
II. Issue 2 : Ambiguity Surrounding Financial Instruments.,0
6. Account statements ( and scores of emails and online messages ) were removed from the website and the complainant was denied access to ( correct ) information. Citi bank/Best Buy repeatedly willfully failed to provide the total unlawfully charged interest and penalties imposed and instead provided ridiculous & irrelevant replies,0
Someone from American Express needs to contact the merchant ( which I was told would be done and to date they have not heard from you at all ),0
XXXX said charges would be refunded,0
If you have any further questions. we're here.,0
It has been 30 days and you are in VIOLATION of this law because I am a victim of identi theft!! Please delete these items as soon as possible!,0
I have complained on here already about the root cause of this here complaint. Which the great Consumer Financial Protection Bureau and its complete uselessness,0
Blocked me from accessing my account online closed my account and reported delinquency to credit monitoring.,0
"I received a notice from Citibank on XX/XX/XXXX that states \\\" payments amounts greater than minimum due are applied to balances with higher APRs before balances with lower rates '' however",0
Merchant,0
I received an email asking me to leave feedback regarding my in-store purchase. I then promptly called in and reported the fraud / unauthorized purchases and requested to close my account.,0
I called in immediately and reported a stolen card and again asked Macy 's to close my account.,0
Though I use the credit card irregularly,0
A credit monitoring service from XXXX ( which I have instituted following this incident ) is now alerting me that this account shows an interest charge and a balance.,0
I filed an online Fraud/ID Theft report with the Colorado Bureau of Investigations this morning,0
1. I disputed a {$700.00} charge on my XXXX XXXX from Ashley. XXXX approved my dispute. Ashley unilaterally charged the amount that XXXX credited to the store credit card without my authorization or signature.,0
A remedy for my specific situation,0
Some credit card security.,0
I'm refusing to give it to them because that's just another number they can make screwups with - I have no dispute about the amount charged to the DEBIT card.,0
2. I have never been late on any credit account I have,0
I also filed a police incident report as requested and forwarded the information on to the banks Fraud Department.,0
I hope you can address the issue with Well Fargo,0
2. Stripping Consumers of Equitable Interests : By engaging in unfair practices,0
This was not a matter of us changing our minds or not showing up. If we had been a no-show,0
The company can't,0
The credit card company isnt resolving the charges. Instead they have told me I must investigate this myself.,0
Issue Date of the New Card : XX/XX/2023.,0
Obviously I cant be in another state and make any of these transactions on XXXX XXXX.,0
( Please reference Exhibit A-2 ) XXXX has a policy for consumers that if any order from XXXX HAS NOT YET SHIPPED,0
The disputed {$5400.00} transaction consists of XXXX flights : ( XXXX ) outbound from XXXX to XXXX to XXXX to XXXX ; ( XXXX ) XXXX to XXXX to XXXX. The costs were split down the middle for each leg after the application of our Capital One Travel miles. These were first class tickets. In dealing with our complaint,0
If you require any further information or clarification regarding this dispute,0
Furthermore : A similarish situation arose with Synchrony and me earlier this year. I also complained then to your Bureau- but after temporarily becoming reasonable,0
I waited for another week or so,0
American Express scheduled my due date on XX/XX/XXXX even though it is a national and banking holiday. I used my bank 's bill pay service to send the payment on XX/XX/XXXX so it would arrive a day before the due date on XX/XX/XXXX. Attached is a copy of my bill pay statement showing the payment would be sent on XXXX and received on XXXX. Also attached is my bank statement showing the XXXX payment cleared my bank on XXXX. A month later I noticed American Express didn't credit my account until XX/XX/XXXX,0
The problem is after six months they accrued my interest and late fees and now stated that my balance is {$970.00} and I owed them {$3000.00}.,0
There is no excuse for not informing me of what is being done and why it is necessary. Denial of service when I have done all I can to assist in this fraud prosecution is an insult that must not be allowed to continue. If they are doing this as a corporate policy to all customers then you need to prosecute or warn others that this is how WF treats customers and put them out of business of defrauding the public by advertising credit and customer service they do not provide.,0
Capital One and the merchant Parts for repair are fully liable. And in this case I am owed the/a full refund. Capital One is responsible for purchase protection and is clearly negligent as is the merchant. The Law was not followed and I never did agree to the purchase requirements of shipping items back to XXXX. ( And being charged outstanding international shipping rates. Prices that are not reasonable ) I required 'refund protection ' from Capital One Financial XXXX Capital One was a total failure in every aspect and only sided with the merchant based on contact. And did not take into consideration the actuality and fact based information. -no return policy was received has no basis for a denied claim.,0
I kindly request that the Financial Consumer Bureau investigate this matter promptly and thoroughly. I seek resolution in the form of a refund for the erroneous fees and interest charges imposed on my account. I have attached relevant documents,0
We have been extremely proactive in trying to prevent further charges from day 1. We contacted the vendor first,0
I called capital one last week and was told i could apply again,0
Although I have sent the XXXX  correspondence to USAA showing XXXX agreeing to a refund and my flight being canceled,0
Upon receiving a letter from them a couple weeks ago that said they intended to close my account if I did not use it by XXXX,0
I attempted to locate a phone number to no avail. Their website is extremely limited on ways to contact them. I finally was able to get a real phone number and then their system did not allow me to speak to anyone unless I had my full card # - the very card I did not have after shredding it!! Through my credit report I located a number that got me to their collections department.,0
I contacted capital one to dispute the charge and they,0
Reopen my Costco Anywhere visa Credit card ending in XXXX ( account since XX/XX/XXXX ) with a Credit limit of {$12000.00} with the current balance of - {$100.00} Restore my previous rewards cash back from XXXX to {$220.00} that is supposed to be mailed to me later this year on XX/XX/XXXX statement.,0
XX/XX/2023 -- FreeMsg : OneMain Fraud Ctr : Thank you. Your card is temporarily locked. We will call,0
I also received a notification of a XXXX XXXX  XXXX  purchase today XX/XX/2023 that I did not make.,0
Hi there,0
A check for XXXX was issued to XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,0
I believed that to be the case,0
Can someone competent please review my application and documents I sent in and move forward with the application process?,0
I asked why would they hold my money for 8 days and not just apply the money now. According to USAA because the account is delinquent.,0
I believe that they charged this account off during the covid relief. It is abnormal for an account to get charged off in less than 2 years. Especially without contacting the account holder. I would also like the letter that I was promised in writing 3 years ago stating what they found in their investigation.,0
I paid the total amount regardless that I did not made this transaction,0
We are experiencing higher than normal call volume No,0
I contacted Wellsfargo to report the unauthorized charge. We thought my account XXXX have been compromised. Wellsfargo suggested to issue me a new card and closing my account. And they will take care of the unauthorized charge.,0
Fast forward another month,0
I live in Colorado. I have never applied for a Wayfair credit card,0
This nightmare has dragged on for almost eight months.,0
On XX/XX/2023 - I received a response from XXXX that stated RBFCU confirmed that the balance was accurate despite me uploading a copy of my most recent XX/XX/2023 bank statement showing the accurate amount.,0
"XXXX : Called the \\\" new number '' I was provided for the fraud department after 2 minutes of explaining that I needed information on the claim they hunt up on me.",0
FIRST LET ME STATE THAT I AM NEWLY XXXX XXXX XXXX SERVNG IN THE XXXX XXXX XXXX. I WAS ENTICED TO APPLY FOR THIS CARD FOR 2 REASONS : 1. BEING AN XXXX XXXX MILITARY SERVICEMEN MY ANNUAL FEE IS WAIVED BY AMEX.,0
American Express lacks sufficient internal controls. American Expressed charged a membership fee to a closed account. How is it possible to post charges to a closed account? This was done by American Express for their own benefit and to the detriment of their customer.,0
I then decided to dispute the charge with Capital One and they sided with the Post Office stating that the purchase receipt states that all sales are final!,0
I contacted Citigroup the day I identified the issue and seeking to resolve this issue.,0
I asked for an explanation as to how we could fly home as they had needlessly and arbitrarily prevented us from flying on our purchased flight and the XXXX XXXX agents told us to exit the area and go down to the XXXX XXXX ticketing counter to re-book our flights.,0
I became aware of the account XX/XX/2023. He spent {$2200.00} of the XXXX limit.,0
Dear XXXX XXXX,0
Keep using your card for purchases in store and online,0
They cancelled my credit card and send me a new one that I received approx. 1 week later.,0
After leaving a review that XXXX directed me to I received an email the following day stating that the damages have increased to XXXX Euros and to transfer the money to their bank account.,0
I subsequently received two more letters from Capital One,0
they are unwilling to help me.,0
Now that Citibank has illegally refused to perform the discharge and are in default because they failed to provide a notice of dishonor from a qualified third party such as the US Treasury,0
XXXX made a purchase with a vendor and returned an item valued at {$350.00} on XX/XX/XXXX. It was scanned in by the carrier and acknowledged on the vendor website.,0
2.	For some reason as yet unexplained,0
Do patients know that the financial world uses client data to make financial decisions?,0
My concern,0
2 ) I contacted TD Bank on XX/XX/23 and spoke with XXXX. A charming young lady who assured me not to worry. Fees would all be taken off bill,0
The customer service people who handled my call were unskilled,0
The attached documentation clearly indicates that this reservation was made with a XXXX,0
XXXX stated they needed a transmittal number and an ACH information form,0
I authorized who I am and recited last 4 numbers of the 2 cards so I know which one to pay. He kept cutting me off saying NOPE,0
I have been charged and paid my account balance for the amount in question.,0
I wanted to restore my cards to their previous states,0
I submitted dispute XX/XX/XXXX and XXXX and am STILL Waiting for a resolution. These charges were made WITHOUT MY AUTHORIZATION and by a hacker. I do not live or have travelled outside of country.,0
By the time I returned home from my job the bill was already due on XX/XX/. I paid for this fraudulent charge on XX/XX/XXXX  not wanting this unauthorized purchase to affect my credit and having no other recourse than Consumer Financial Protection Agency. I plan to close out all of my accounts with this company this week since they have coerced me into paying for a fraudulent purchase I did not make. I have never heard of a credit card company forcing a customer to pay for an unauthorized purchase.,0
And was told a Manager should be contacting me within 24/48 hrs.,0
I reached out to QuickCustomer Care on XX/XX/XXXX,0
2 ) Macys credit card services aggressively went a 1 week late payment on small balance. I received 4 to 5 calls a day for over a week for a balance of {$350.00}. I had only received a paper copy of the statement the same week the collection phone calls began.,0
As you look at my credit card statements,0
When we reached out we were told that the charges would be flagged as fraud but that was the only way to dispute it through our credit card.,0
I called back on XX/XX/XXXX to make payment and my card was closed due to it being the second charge back.,0
They can't send me anything confirming that I have no open accounts and owe no money. They also can not make outbound calls so I have to sit here the entire morning on hold.,0
I advised them that was not correct and filed a dispute. I got my new statement for XX/XX/2023 stated my balance was XXXX I called and I filed a dispute the agent told me they did not see any payments made by me for XXXX and I filed another dispute,0
15 USC 1681 Section 604 A Section 2 : It also states a consumer reporting agency can not furnish a account without my written instructions.,0
XXXX said the Fortiva employee also advised her the {$3800.00} charge was made at XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX. It is unknown how the purchase was made,0
Break up Citibank!!!!,0
I'd like to emphasize the terms and agreement were not fully explained to me and were sent after I opened this credit account. In the agreement,0
Please also be advised that this letter is not only a formal dispute,0
To Whom it May Concern.,0
Credit card issued on or about XXXX XXXX XXXX  with account ending in XXXX.,0
I met all other conditions of the offer.,0
After the complaint I received further communication via mail and phone that indicates that the amount that was previously offered to me months back is not the same as of today XX/XX/2023. I believe that Chase is retaliating towards me for my initial complaint to your agency.,0
It is my understanding that my request to NFCU is valid in accordance to 12 USC 1026.15 Right of rescission.,0
I spoke to countless Synchrony customer support specialists,0
After learning of this interest charge I made phone calls yesterday XX/XX/XXXX I never would have used this card for a purchase. I complained last night and ended up getting a supervisor who advised me that they would review this and in less than 12 hours I get an email stating the request was declined. I called today and spoke with XXXX more agents. There first could only help me in getting the information to file a complaint and the second guy XXXX who works with card cancellations tried to help but it had already been through a review. He did make the remark that I could use the rewards from my credit card to pay for the accrued interest,0
( Please reference Exhibit XXXX ) On XXXX Comenity Bank re-applied charge of {$580.00} without explanation and/or without result finalizing dispute opened on XXXX.,0
Denial of Resources : I specifically requested information and resources related to XXXX to voice my concerns,0
I even provided a receipt from another contractor who I hired to complete my service.,0
The reason ( s ) for our decision are listed below : * Activity on account with Synchrony Bank indicative of high risk of failure to pay.,0
XXXX refunded the barbells and promised a 20 % refund for the order as well as I could keep the dip bars and pull up bars with a full refund on that. I only received the refund for the Barbells.,0
Thank you for your attention to this matter.,0
XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX,0
I logged into TD bank online account on XX/XX/XXXX only ( after initial setup in XX/XX/XXXX ) to see verify the balance on this account,0
I attempted to make a purchase on XXXX  at XXXX and I received no online invoice until XXXX,0
XXXX filing this complaint. Will bring lawyers into the situation if needed.,0
"Unsubscribe From This List | Manage Email Preferences '' And here is another : \\\" Subject : Thank you for being Paypal 's customer!",0
I also recieved correspondence requiring my account that had incorrect information in it.,0
Synchrony informed me that the account would remain closed and that the credit line was removed. The account balance continues to be paid timely and no payment has ever been late. In fact,0
I work in the XXXX XXXX and my income is quite variable,0
Not long afterwards the reimbursement {$100.00} arrived to my account from XXXX. I informed Capital One and went about my trip with my partner. At some point XXXX XXXX not paying attention as they say they do with all their XXXX  advertising ignored the fact the dispute had been resolved.. and sent {$97.00} to my account. No notification came to me concerning the deposit.,0
I then contacted the comenity.net credit card customer service.,0
Ashley ' furniture will be accepting the chargeback in the amount of {$700.00} dollars.,0
So after contacting the company by telephone 8 times,0
Given these indisputable facts,0
I called Chase Bank XXXX for an explanation and was told the issue would have to be escalated and reviewed. I would get a letter of explanation in XXXX business days.,0
Citi bank has been incorrectly applying extra payments ( not counting minimum payment ) since XX/XX/XXXX to date on my account ending in XXXX : XXXX {$1000.00} XXXX {$300.00} XXXX {$2400.00} XXXX {$600.00} XXXX {$300.00} XXXX {$930.00} XXXX {$1000.00} XXXX {$1000.00} XXXX {$1300.00}.,0
The reason that I believe Barclay 's has made this bad faith decision is because part of my income derives from a public assistance program,0
I called the very same day and asked for refunds ( because no tickets were booked! ). I was told that I needed to wait for XXXX hours before they could initiate a refund. I called them on XX/XX/XXXX and enquired about the refunds. After spending XXXX minutes on the phone,0
I have such compelling evidence as customer,0
I look forward to your favorable response.,0
This is how they are doing it. Say your credit limit is {$2000.00}. As an Apple Card holder,0
I have called CB/BF and spoke with at least 3 managers over the last several months and have explained how the payment was made via secure messages on their website,0
After many back and forth messages ( with some of my messages being completely ignored ),0
Thank you for your consideration in this matter.,0
- In XXXX of XXXX,0
Im also requesting only my transunion file be soft pulled for the credit decision.,0
I just applied again snd received the card Ive used it snd paid it off again. I just got a letter via XXXX stating theyve closed that account again.,0
At no time during setting up that Payment Plan or Cancelling the XXXX auto-payment was I made aware by Discover that they would report my account 30 days late to the credit bureaus because of the remaining past due balance that was spread across those 3 payments. Additionally,0
D. From : XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Date : XX/XX/2023 at XXXX XXXX EDT To : XXXX Subject : RE : XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX CASE XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Hello XXXX,0
AGAIN - THIRD TIME!!!,0
Resolution/Outcome : The proposed resolution was to reapply for another credit card.,0
Turns out I didn't recognize it because it was the last XXXX digits of that replacement card I NEVER activated.,0
XX/XX/XXXX  Received an email from Apple that there was an issue with the payment on the order and I needed to update my payment method. My Apple Card was still blocked,0
I then called Bank of America ( on XX/XX/XXXX ) about the flight purchase in the amount of {$690.00} on XX/XX/XXXX and that it should have been refunded to my account already as XXXX XXXX sent it on XX/XX/XXXX and offered to provide them with the ARN number as XXXX XXXX had given me that. They said they didn't know why it hadn't posted to my account,0
4 ) Every customer service rep I spoke to on the phone wanted my social security number. They repeatedly asked for it,0
I had not been in arrears.,0
In addition to these issues,0
I have contacted Wells Fargo multiple times and do not expect a resolution without litigation,0
This is not even a merchant transaction on the credit card. Even if I purchase something by accident,0
2 ) Nowhere on the portal,0
I was asked to pay a 50 % ( {$350.00} ) down payment which I did with my credit card.,0
I am XXXX XXXX XXXX and on a fixed income. I would never sign a disclosure with a balloon payment of almost {$4100.00} interest due immediately.,0
Credit Card companies like Fortiva is no different than payday loans that charge upwards of 500 %. Make your min payment of {$60.00} and not use it,0
I discovered this 2 days after the due date and called to pay it in full immediately,0
Please do'nt hesitate to contact me if you need any further details/documentation!,0
I was verifying the no balance due on XX/XX/11,0
This included the paperwork where I would highlight damage to the vehicle. I asked twice in front of 3 colleagues. She refused and said it was not necessary. She told us the keys were in the vehicle and gave us a small card with the vehicles location in the parking garage. When we checked the vehicle out there was no one there to greet us or go over any prior scratches to the vehicle. As the vehicle was already covered with general wear and tear scratches we took a video of the vehicle and left the garage. The small scratches were already there.,0
The amount in question is {$3400.00} This is an ongoing case since XX/XX/2023.,0
cfpb,0
They mislead,0
I respectfully request that the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau conducts a comprehensive investigation into this matter and takes appropriate action against Self Financial Inc. for their breach of contract and their failure to honor arbitration obligations.,0

This is what is in their Addendum. i copied ands pasted it.,0
Please ask Chase to immediately remove this {$99.00} Annual Membership Fee from my closed credit card account.,0
I was told the amount I owed,0
Here is the exact verbiage from the Wayfair Credit Card and Wayfair Mastercard Rewards Program Terms : a. Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars for Net Eligible Purchases. You will earn Wayfair Credit Card Reward Dollars for Net Eligible Purchases so long as your Credit Card is in Good Standing.,0
They have already caused damage to my credit score by simply canceling my card.,0
XXXX said she contacted Fortiva Credit and advised the customer service employee she has never applied or opened a Fortiva Credit Card Account.,0
Amex however,0
I received a letter from Wayfair Security Operations dated XXXX XXXX XXXX confirming that the account was closed and that they would investigate the charges. I was unaware then that,0
2. I did not receive several items that i ordered,0
Next day,0
I called American Express and told them that I was the victim of fraud since the account had been paid off and closed on XX/XX/XXXX. I didnt make any purchases.,0
Undelivered Refund : I have yet to receive the refund check of {$11000.00} that I was promised on XX/XX/XXXX.,0
As I said,0
I submitted a claim with the credit card company ( BofA ). They initially said I didnt have to pay the disputed amount ( {$78.00} ). However,0
They canceled my card for that reason. I did not have any payments overdue. They even said that was not justifying reason to cancel my card,0
3. Denying Convertibility of Coupon Bonds : Coupon bonds typically grant bondholders the option to convert their bonds into shares of stock at a predetermined ratio. However,0
Reporting of this incident was recorded on my body camera.,0

15 U.S.C. 1681 Section 602 A,0
( i ) Except as provided in paragraph ( a ) ( XXXX ) ( ii ) of this section,0
XXXX I completed required paperwork and mailed back to Bank of America XXXX,0
Contacted all creditors and reported fraud,0
This was very deceitful from teh beginning,0
The first complaint I sent them was last year,0
"XX/XX/XXXX XXXX SAME DAY : I open my mail to find letter below stating inaccurate info : that my application was not approved because \\\" A prior credit card or deposit account was closed by Chase '' Reference Number : XXXX I have never had a credit card or deposit account with chase.",0
I very promptly replied to BOA 's arguably burdensome inquires. I.e. BOA requested information already provided as well as mailed multiple requests that could have easily been combined into a single inquiry. Additionally BOA asked for information to be returned in a timeline not reasonable by today 's Postal Mail standards.,0
"XXXX statement : The \\\" Amount to avoid Standard and Deferred Interest '' is XXXX by XX/XX/XXXX. Paid XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Special financing ending : none.",0
Issue # 1 - they asked for my whole credit card number or my social security number to be provided to triage who i am before connecting me to a service representative.,0
After waiting the 7 to 10 business day I was told it would take to reprocess the payment to the Merchant,0
6. I requested that the adverse report to the credit monitoring agencies be rescinded and corrected. My request was declined by Bank of America.,0
Now my issue is that Bank of America is grossly misleading people in believing that {$100.00} credit applies to any airlines in their marketing material with no mention of conditions apply or an indicator like asterisk that it applies to certain Airlines only. How are we supposed to know to check on such fine print?,0
After the call,0
Despite numerous attempts to seek clarification and resolution by visiting my local branch on five separate occasions,0
Come last month I get a {$30.00} late fee and I know what is next addional fee 's so I wrote them again and got a bot that didn't answer any questions. So I waited till the next day and wrote them. They said they removed the last late fee ( Which was their fought ) and will not remove anymore.,0
I diligently met the spending requirement within the promotion 's time frame,0
I called again,0
I have spoken to multiple people at American Express as well as at XXXX however,0
Synchronys agent who tried to help me at first did not see that I had already paid the {$40.00} minimum ( about 2 days earlier ) and initially told me that in order to avoid interest charges I would have to pay {$750.00} ). He eventually saw that I had already paid {$40.00},0
This isnt a case of he said she said,0
Request for reimbursement to the company have been unsuccessful as they claim some interval change in ownership and an absence of responsibility for any prior unfulfilled purchases,0
I deeply appreciate your attention to this matter and your role in safeguarding the rights of consumers.,0
They are not an accredited educational institution to issue XXXX XXXX XXXX certifications per my employer. I explained this to Goldman Sachs,0
Discover : Our customer service agents are available 24/7 and can be reached by calling XXXX.,0
Since that time I have received no progress in resolving the situation and the account and accruing late payments continue to stay on my credit report,0
There are no terms and conditions to click on with the XXXX XXXX that deducted the {$510.00}. They put a timer for you to enter the information and give a false amount. US Bank allowed them to give them screen grabs as their evidence that I knew the amount and agreed to their terms which were falsified.,0
Citi Reference Number : XXXX for the dispute XXXX I opened with XXXX vendor in XX/XX/2023 for the amount of {$3900.00} despite.,0
I've tried sending the code to XXXX but my apologies,0

"This past week I contacted Citi first by chat and then by telephone to try to negotiate a lower rate. AT NO TIME DID I TELL OR WOULD HAVE TOLD CITI I WAS EXPERIENCING FINANCIAL HARDSHIP. The responses I received twice were that \\\" there is no lower rate available for this product. '' I was not happy and I ended the second call having expressed that sentiment.",0
Absence of Remedial Measures : Unlike other financial institutions that provide customers with alerts or options to dispute unauthorized charges,0
Dismissive Behavior : On several occasions,0
After a lot of back and forth I gave up on them and contacted the American express to retrieve my money they initially credited my account based on the information which I provided subsequently I have provided them with all the evidence and written communication between myself and XXXX XXXX.,0
I asked him if I have a balance he said no. I told him I keep getting calls from bill collector than he says yes I have balance.,0
XX/XX/XXXX XXXX from Chase Executive Office called to say he was assigned the claim XXXX x XXXX Reference Number : XXXX XX/XX/XXXX XXXX - contacted XXXX claims supervisor - XXXX said claim submitted to management for approval to release payment.

Being transfered to XXXX. - Call disconnected - XXXX called back.,0
The couch was not delivered within the expected ( XXXX weeks ) timeframe and so my wife ( XXXX XXXX ) made a complaint regarding this issue to XXXX soon thereafter on XX/XX/XXXX ( XXXX claim ID # XXXX ).,0

"The new terms are specifically two documents : - a 10-page \\\" Online and Mobile E-Sign Disclosure and Consent Agreement '' and - a 125-page \\\" Digital Services Agreement '' There is no summary of changes to know what is different compared to before.",0

"Account No- Costco Anywhere visa Credit card ending in XXXX ( account since XX/XX/XXXX )- with a -Credit limit of {$12000.00} with the current balance of \\\" - {$100.00} '' -Restore my previous rewards Costco cash back from XXXX to {$220.00} that is supposed to be mailed to me later this year on the end of XX/XX/XXXX statement.",0
"XX/XX/2023 -- I receive the following text message : \\\" FreeMs : OneMain Fraud Ctr : XXXX Case XXXX Did you attempt {$32.00} at XXXX * XXXX XXXX with card XXXX? Reply YES or NO. Opt Out reply STOP '' Given the card has now been closed for over a month",0
To expedite the resolution of this matter,0
Me : And why is that?,0
XXXX ) I was not able to actively pursue this case after I reported this case to Capitalone in XXXX XXXX because I suffered a Massive XXXX XXXX in XX/XX/XXXX which incapacitated me. My health continued to deteriorate up until XX/XX/XXXX that is when I had an XXXX XXXX XXXX. I am still recovering from that XXXX.,0
This all seems fraudulent to me. If no one complains they get XXXX XXXX  from many because of it. Even complaining they don't seem to comply. I do not understand why it was not immediately resolved as it seemed an error on their part.,0
I again called the Fraud Department to inform them that the charges were not removed but placed back on the new account. Their investigation did include charges that were made without my authorization at the locations specified in the report.,0
Our disputes with Barclay were not accepted because we previously did business with XXXX.,0
This is unfair deceptive acts and practices ( UDAAP ) to arbitrarily apply payments to the smaller more recent purchase than to the first purchase. If I had known how my payments would be applied,0
On XX/XX/XXXX I received a letter from BOA ( Dated XXXX ) stating that the case had been closed because additional information was not sufficient or received in a timely manner.,0
They state that I have to FAX a copy of my driver 's license and Social Security card to them. As it is XXXX,0
A police report was attempted to be filed but because the occurrence was on a XXXX XXXX XXXX line,0
I go to the bank thinking itll be a quick process. I spent apporx XXXX HOURS (!!!!! ) in the branch to get the matter resolved.,0
*My landlord statement so they could see that I WAS THE ONE PAYING MY XX/XX/XXXX PAYMENT not them.,0
I called many times after that and would always get the no supervisors are available. All I wanted was to see the evidence they used to make the determination that I was in fact the person who made that purchase at XXXX XXXX. They noted the XXXX provided evidence and was interested in what was provided. Finally,0
I AM XXXX. I SERVE IN THE XXXX. I DO NOT HAVE THE ABILITY WITH MY LOW SALARY TO JUST SHOP UNCONTROLLABLY AND PAY OFF $ XXXX. HAD I KNOWN THIS WHEN THE CARD WAS INSTANTLY APPROVED,0
I waited and waited and did not see a refund to my credit card for the purchase. In XXXX I contacted and spoke with XXXX and they confirmed the refund would be coming from XXXX XXXX directly so I needed to speak with them. On XX/XX/XXXX I called XXXX XXXX and they confirmed that they sent my refund on XX/XX/XXXX to my credit card. I happened to book my underlying seat with one card ( Bank of America ) and a seat upgrade with a different card ( XXXX ),0
3. The card number ending in XX/XX/2023 has not been used in many years. It has carried a XXXX balance for at least 4 years.,0
I scoured the website,0
"I asked the agent to setup AUTOPAY for me- she replied that she could not do that. The agent began by directing me to a link on the Credit Card account page called \\\" Pay & Transfer ''.",0
they placed my card on hold on XX/XX/XXXX. l called them and had a 3 way call with my bank to verify it was in fact my bank account. Mind you,0
-- We could not stay at the property we reserved because of the horrible smell and for over $ XXXX,0
-- XX/XX/XXXX - XXXX informed us that it was up to XXXX XXXX XXXX to provide a resolution.,0
Thank you in advance.,0
I immediately called Wells Fargo to notify them of the fraud and they took down my statement. I indicated that the card was not in my possession when the fraud occurred. The person on the phone told me they would review my claim over the next 10 business days. Wells Fargo then reversed the fraudulent transactions,0
Remove these late payments and update this account immediately,0
"I requested a copy of my statements as well as a copy of the signed disclosure from CareCredit/Synchrony Bank XXXX I requested my statements for beginning XXXX to present as well as a signed copy of the \\\" Promotional '' disclosure in XXXX",0
The point I tried to make with Wells Fargo was what was the use of cancelling the hacked card so it couldn't be use but charging the replacement credit card I NEVER activated,0
Later that night,0
call being disconnected after talking to Fraud for over 1 hour,0
No careful review occurred because prior to XX/XX/XXXX,0
Citibank has refused to remove charges and give the cardholder a new account number,0
I don't believe the credit card company can unilaterally impose a requirement that I obtain a document that is impossible to obtain. I'm not aware of any requirement in the law. This appears to be an internal procedure created by Chase.,0
Re-applying would cause a new hard pull on my credit and I doubt if I would get approved again for all cards I had given,0
I have mailed no less than 7 letters to Citibank regarding these unauthorized charges. They have since reported to the credit agencies that this is a delinquent account,0
Please help to get this situation resolved.,0
Citi apparently decides to routinely ignore the fact that there are known attacks against EMV ( a.k.a. chips ) and immediately rule against the consumer.,0
Turns out the reason why I couldn't activate the card was because it was already used internally by someone in their own office charging items even before my card was activated in the amount of {$140.00} in XXXX CA no less. We have not been to CA in 30 years and have XXXX intention of visiting in the future.,0
I am so outraged by this sequence of events that I can not adequately begin to determine what I need to do to keep my money safe. Obviously I have to clear out my Chase accounts and move to another bank,0
I have had this card for over 30 years,0
A note on XXXX Now Decide Later Orders : You have 30 days to assign a fabrie to your piece ( XXXX ). When you're ready,0

I put the first claim of the fraud for {$1100.00} on XX/XX/2023,0
We contacted Chase again,0
Our system isn't cooperating,0
They in return as of today killed my log in. So I know they are going to try to get fee 's,0
I made a call and paid the bill as soon as I received an alert of a returned ACH payment,0
They originally offered a settlement of {$500.00} but now they are only accepting {$990.00}.,0
If they received the funds on XX/XX/XXXX  the merchant needed to give me access immediately instead of told me to pay again if I needed access to the system on XX/XX/.,0
After XXXX,0
Chase decided against me in the dispute due to the reason of the dispute. Chase assisted me with selecting the reason! I have redisputed the charge twice now and call chase dispute team every couple of weeks begging for help. Chase will no longer assist me and advised me to go directly to the XXXX XXXX. I have tried contacting XXXX directly but they refer me back to my card issuer-Chase.,0
i called up to dispute and they did not help me with that.,0
A written confirmation detailing the resolution of these matters.,0
I get that terms get updated -- but forcing people to agree to something they do NOT have time to read? XXXX XXXX XXXX,0

Please see 3 attached snap shots of my dashboard I asked the representative why don ' they send a simple encrypted email or a letter or just call my cellular? then she hung up on me.,0
I was notified by my credit monitoring application,0
I sent an email that provided the following 'Please do not ship item Please cancel and/ or hold order. I have not agreed to purchase '.,0
6 ) SOLUTION!!,0
I sent them over screenshots showing every month I have paid over the amount due and some months I pay 2 payments to help pay the bill off before interest occurs. I told them to show me proof of why the payment is late and showing them proof that I always have made the payment on time. And even went on to say this happened before and it was your error.,0
"I did try to Contact synchrony Bank via Chat on Tuesday XX/XX/XXXX. Spent about a half hour taking with them to get no answer just told me to \\\" call Walgreens customer service \\\" which makes no sense as the credit card",0
XX/XX/XXXX Target sent another letter declining my dispute stating : You documentation we received from you on XX/XX/XXXX was not sufficient and did not indicate a letter from your banking institution stating that your checking account was open and active,0
There were no statements sent and there were no phone calls made. I reached out to synchrony about this and they gave me the runaround and we're supposed to send me after 30 days following my complaint and dispute documentation. They never did. I reached out again and they told me 45 days every time I'd call they tell me it would be another 15 to 30. I actually had my mortgage lender reach out as well to document these calls with us. I reached out over 12 times and they would never let me speak with anyone to go over my account. They kept telling me that they were going to send me a decision via mail. They never did.,0
This is not normal spending for an individual and their algorithm did not pick it up nor was my account blocked.,0
"I spoke to them and they simply stated \\\" sorry",0
15 USC 1681 Section 604 A Section 2 : It also states a consumer reporting agency can not furnish an account without my written instructions.,0
*First Capital One made an error on XX/XX/XXXX ( reference letter ) charging me back {$490.00},0
The request was not heeded and the bank took out the {$95.00} out of the positive balance I have had with them and then refunded the remainder.,0
My email address at the time was XXXX but that email account is closed. I just provided the email address so you could find my previous complaint.,0
I clearly have the funds in my account and was successful making payments for many months without issue and I still continue to make payments to others from the same bank account.,0
- Because I both retained my physical card,0
Hopefully a more careful reading of the email chain will demonstrate to the anonymous author that credit which was offered by the merchant was only for the three undamaged cases of material.,0
I believe this is a clear case of mishandling and failure to properly resolve a dispute. I kindly request that the CFPB investigates this matter to ensure a fair and just resolution.,0
I immediately received notice of this charge and contacted GS with my dispute.,0
I asked them to remove the charge as the card is not active,0
Over the course of about the next month or so after being approved for the card I spent over {$1000.00}. After not seeing the bonus I reached out to customer service at PNC via their app,0
The letter says there was a conditional credit issued for the disputed amount along with any related fees and interest charges while your inquiry is under review.,0

WAYFAIR AND CITIBANK - FRAUD,0
Kohls reply letter stated the late charge was removed. Problem is they did not remove the 2nd late charge nor interest Follow-up letter sent outlining the problem and needed solution. No response received.,0
Please help reverse these charges. I have never been involved in any fraudulent charges. I am a XXXX XXXX XXXX female student and can not absorb these blatantly fraudulent charges.,0
Around XXXX of XXXX,0
I hit the threshold very quickly,0
-- We showed up for our reservation in good faith that what we paid for was what we had been promised. We made good-faith efforts to resolve the issue for a few hours once we arrived. All of our family members were driving hours to gather together. We showed up in good faith and the host clearly did not deliver what they promised.,0
Around that same time my account was adjusted to reflect a credit of {$7200.00} while you investigated the issue. You also removed the payment from the Merchant and that is when the communication picked back up.,0
If you have any questions,0
This bank makes many excuses and tactics to not increase customer 's credit limit even though the customer has met the criteria to be eligible for XXXX.,0

XXXX ( A little over a month later ) I received a letter from Barclays saying they had investigated the incident and they it was not fraud as XXXX provided evidence that the items were picked up. ( Not something I'm disputing,0
On the aforementioned date,0
"I am requesting that you investigate this matter and remove the \\\" Derogatory '' and \\\" XXXX '' marks from my credit report. I am also requesting that Bank of America should reopen my credit card.",0
I got mad after years of Kohls and the Kohls Cash scams and didn't deal with it as promptly as I should have ( and it was only {$10.00} ),0
They claim it is policy guidelines and refused to correct it. I saved this over 10 years and lost it within XXXX minutes!,0
I have even receive a physical letter from citi stating in has been fixed ( which I have included in my documents ) it has not been fixed to date Why is this so complicated... this has to happen all the time.,0
I got the new phone and I returned the previous phone on the same day around the last week of XXXX.,0
they have been able to make charges using my information. I did not give the card to anyone to use. Their fraud department needs to do more research on how somebody made charges in another state using my information.,0
I called American Express on XX/XX/2023,0
XXXX. ) Amex told me last year,0
I firmly believe that this situation is not only unfair but also unacceptable. As a loyal customer,0
I request that you promptly investigate this matter in accordance with both 15 USC 1681b and 15 USC 1681c-2 and provide me with a written notification of the results of your investigation,0
I was left to scramble and find another vehicle. I was able to take an XXXX from XXXX XXXX to XXXX XXXX XXXX where I was able to secure a mid-size SUV.,0
I kindly request that the CFPB investigates this matter thoroughly and takes necessary actions to rectify the situation. Wells Fargo should be held accountable for the adverse consequences this decision has had on my financial well-being.,0
XXXX said on XX/XX/XXXX  she received a text message alert from XXXX XXXX  and XXXX Credit Bureau which alerted her a charge of {$3800.00} was made on her Fortiva Credit Card.,0
Credit was refused because I have a Paypal card mailed to my house.,0
Upon noticing the reappearance of the charge,0
The family and I had an upcoming trip in XXXX and payment was needed by XX/XX/. On XX/XX/XXXX  I transferred from a Bank of America checking account to my Bank of America credit card account with cleared funds {$63000.00}. I told XXXX that the purpose was to pay for a trip in XXXX. After all but approximately {$29000.00} was paid. I spoke to a supervisor XXXX in California. He told me to try again. XXXX also told me that the credit card limit was set by Visa and not the bank. Before getting off the telephone with him,0
After I received refusal for my initial fraud claim,0
I have contacted XXXX over 6 times and each time they confirmned none of those charges are against my account. Despite this Citigroup has refused to resolve the issue. I have communicated with Citigroup over a dozen times all to no avail.,0
XX/XX/23 - {$37.00} late payment fee applied which we believe is violating the Fair Credit Billing Act on disputed charges.,0
Gemini requested me proof of no access to XXXX XXXX system and I sent proof of no access dated XX/XX/2023 showing the system didnt allow me to access the System. Then Gemini answered me that I actually needed to proof that I didnt have access after XX/XX/2023,0
The final merchant XXXX XXXX XXXX in XXXX XXXX,0
I had a credit card with usaa that ended up becoming delinquent and added to my credit report.,0
It was confirmed the payment was received XX/XX/XXXX via a phone call XX/XX/XXXX. I was then informed that I would have to wait until the XXXX for them to apply the money to my account.,0
The Claim number with Wells Fargo is XXXX,0
"XXXX statement : The \\\" Amount to avoid Standard and Deferred Interest '' is XXXX. Special financing due by XX/XX/XXXX is XXXX. XXXX paid XXXX and an additional XXXX",0
The scenario is as follows. I made two purchases for the same dollar amount from the same merchant XXXX. Both charges are for the same item in different sizes. I returned BOTH and have 2 separate receipts for each item returned where the merchant promised me a refund.,0
( I might add that the worst part of this ordeal is how Amex completely disregards me as a customer dragging this on for months and not even communicating with me. Rather they just close the case after several weeks of no communication with a generic response often robotic ).,0
They then made a purchase at XXXX {$5800.00},0
I believe that the charges imposed on my account end with ( last XXXX digit XXXX ) are unjustified and not reflective of the responsible financial behavior I have maintained. The interest charges and late fee are not only excessive but also seem to contradict the principles of fair banking practices and customer relations. As a loyal customer who values transparency and integrity,0
The issue continues with this company and they apparently are not cooperative with simply removing my address from their marketing database. I have made multiple requests for them to stop sending marketing material,0
Please do not reply to this automated email.,0
Meaning I was provided the information that parts for repair does not accept returns? That information is not true,0
I REMOVED him from the account XX/XX/XXXX XXXX,0
I notified CitiCards of the issue and they advised that it was ok. Eventully I got the funds back and my account was brought up to date a short time later.,0
I then chatted with the online rep who told me to call again. I said I have tried and they can not do anything.,0
I contacted Citi via phone on XX/XX/XXXX,0

They are very quick to close the claim - response received XX/XX/23,0
I called XXXX XXXX and I complained about the astringent and rough feeling on the roof of the XXXX and the suggested I come to their office for adjustments. They also suggest they use any eraser on the top of a pencil to rub the roof off the XXXX,0
Now I need to know whom should I contact about the unfair practice of this credit card company? I thought you would be the one but got disappointed.,0
I kindly request that you conduct an investigation into these reported late payments and provide supporting evidence in the form of statements indicating the specific instances of lateness. In the event that concrete proof can not be furnished,0
My nightmare was just starting I called the customer service number to inquire as to why the package was returned after the US Post office had missed the deadline I had paid for. I waited for close to 2 hours for a human being to pick up the phone and when someone finally did,0
Now that I can not pay my account online,0
In summary,0
I have tried to keep my credit usage under the recommended 30 % of my outstanding available credit and in so doing this is one of the cards I have not used as it is at a higher rate than some of my others. But I certainly felt secure and appreciated that this card with a built up {$7500.00} credit limit,0
The below information is what I found.,0

The fraud department said they would check it out. 10 days later I got another letter from the fraud department saying Im due to pay all the charges. I by chance had another appointment with the doctor that I had seen on XX/XX/XXXX and I told her of my problem and she couldnt believe it. She asked if there was anything she could do and I gave her the number of the executive department. The executive department says it sounds like its good and they will send it to the fraud department. Ten days later the fraud department wrote back and said all the charges were my charges. Beware of the Wells Fargo Active Cash Visa Card.,0

We disputed the 2 charges and provided numerous amounts of documents and signatures within he 60 days of the initial charge. They closed out the dispute because CItiBank is too big to research and resolve anything.,0
A concert ticket was purchased from XXXX with good intentions. I didn't I authorize it and contacted XXXX and asked for reimbursement. They agreed and sent an official email confirming it.

Because the return address was located in XXXX the company refused to cover shipping costs. And was requiring that I cover the full burden for shipping items back to their company in XXXX. I did not agree to this deal and requested an immediate refund of my purchase.,0

Following their investigation,0
The transaction date is XX/XX/XXXX the posting date is XX/XX/XXXX the reference number is XXXX. The amount is for XXXX This is the new ticket they gave me after I flew back to XXXX from Florida in XX/XX/XXXX.,0
I am seeking a thorough investigation into the reason for the account closure and would like to know whether it is possible to reinstate my account,0
There is a number on the back of the card to call.,0
I informed them I would be mailing it within 24 hour which I did.,0
It's a credit card and transfers can not be made to a home. They can use a collection agency.,0
I did not apply for a debt card. I did not open an account at XXXX XXXX.,0
Please investigate this matter and report it to US/CA Regulatory Authorities,0
Me : XXXX XXXX,0
At this point I asked for a supervisor and had to provide all the information again to them. They reopened the case in XXXX and I haven't got a update since.,0
XXXX ) I am surprised that Capitalone has no records of my reporting this case to them in Apri/May soon after it happened.,0
Which brings me to today. AMEX limited 2 of my several cards with them. I suspect a repercussion of challenging their billing and credit mishaps.,0
In effect,0
3. United States Codes ( U.S.C. ) : The U.S.C. is a compilation of federal laws enacted by the United States Congress. Pertinent sections within Title 15 of the U.S.C. outline regulations and protections related to consumer finance and securities.,0
I have provided numerous information to Citibank explaining that the contractor contact number and website is no longer available for me to dispute with them for a refund and the 10 charges from XXXX XXXX XXXX was not me.,0
5. I requested a refund of late fees. My request was declined by Bank of America.,0
15 USC 1681 Section 602 States that I have a right to privacy.,0
The collection calls began in early XXXX  and mostly went to my voice mail. Those on the machine and the several phone calls I took,0
Around this time,0
Again my card is blocked Again I answer yes it was me on the phone Again its blocked.,0
We appreciate you reaching out about a payment.,0
So a total of {$1000.00} of fraudulent transactions was attempted to be drawn from my bank account on XX/XX/XXXX. These fraudulent transactions were reported in XXXX. And the company has been made well known by me that this needs to be disputed and removed from my statement as they were not made by me,0
They said I had similar previous charges on my card. So after further investigation I found more fraudulent charges,0
Note : The advertising material published by Ashley via XXXX mailers clearly state the special promotion as Interest Free for the specified promotional finance period without any mention of a term or disclaimer such as if paid in full nor is such a term mentioned in any of the official bill of sale or loan contract documents.,0
XX/XX/23 - {$37.00} late fee refunded which is still not the proper fix.,0
We also received a letter for card XXXX saying we need to pay the current balance {$88.00} with past due amount {$41.00}.,0
Once I accepted the amount they offered they informed me that the payment would be posted once received ( which could only be mailed in,0
the limit occurred after I filed a CFPB complaint.,0
I have been sooooo loyal to Discover Card. It was the first credit card I had. I have had my Discover card for almost 40 years! I cancelled my card. I am done with Discover Card. This company is running scams.,0
"XXXX statement : The \\\" Amount to avoid Standard and Deferred Interest '' is XXXX. No promotional rates ending. Paid XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX which is the minimum amount due.",0
Only to have MY ACCOUNT BLOCKED AGAIN.,0
Fraud continuously trying to transfer me to Customer Service when Customer Service does not handle Fraud Fraud sometimes being able to see the linked merchants,0
"I became aware of a feature known as XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX or \\\" XXXX '' and I believe this service has contributed to the fraudulent activity being perpetrated at my expense. My understanding is there are several merchants",0
-Care Credit made it look like the only downside of choosing to close my account is that I would no longer have access to it. They failed to inform me on how this would negatively impact my overall credit history and how current and future creditors view me.,0
Widespread Consumer Complaints : I have attached letters from the Better Business Bureau that indicate I am not the only victim of XXXX 's fraudulent practices. There appears to be a systemic issue wherein the company locks customers into contracts they have no intention or capacity to fulfill,0
Their Customer Service Staff is the worst in the industry,0
I requested w AMEX to file an internal complaint,0
Customer Service Interaction : Numerous attempts were made to resolve the issue,0
5 ) My XXXX statement is now {$120.00}. I tried to speak with a supervisor and have called this is RIDICULOUS!!,0
XX/XX/2023 : I called Barclays,0
I also reminded them that I had been a royal customer with good standing since XXXX. They refuse my plea so I just walked away from using their charge card with a bitter taste in my mouth since.,0
XX/XX/XXXX XXXX XXXX : I call XXXX. They half remedy the issue by unlocking my account,0
So What's about the information I provided you after That I had to go a XXXX merchant to correct the errors done by the First Agent? I had to spend money and Time for the same repair.,0
During the initial phone call,0
I paid the remaining balance in full to avoid any further fees. My balance should have been {$0.00}.,0
Wayfair directed me to XXXX and,0
The representative acknowledged that there had been an issue and clarified that my account I was using to make payments was classified as a non-transactional account,0
I immediately filed a dispute request with Discover Financial and I sent them a copy of the certified demand letter which was sent to XXXX XXXX which outlined the fact that the goods provided was useless.,0
I continue receiving calls after filing a complaint over a year ago. You have continually allowed multiple accounts to open and be used. We continue to let you know that this needs to be corrected. We have letters and correspondence confirming that you resolved this just to add the fraud charges to my account. These accounts with the balances you have reflected currently need to be corrected. These balances do not belong to us,0
I am including emails I have from XXXX XXXX ( XXXX ) stating that the dispute was found in my favor and they have credited the money back. Of course,0
Called Apple Credit Card and they stated they decreased my credt limit due to low spending.,0
This was also closed,0
After I closed the account,0
"I received a letter from Chase card services in XXXX which offered the opportunity to pay a lower monthly payment or settle the account. I called Chase on XX/XX/2023 to discuss payment options because I am currently on a fixed income ( until XX/XX/2023 ). The first agent I spoke with offered to settle the amount which would require a down payment of {$370.00} and pay off the remaining amount within 3 months. The agent did not give a total settlement amount ; he only asked me if I could pay 25 % of the balance. My response was \\\" no '' because I couldn't commit to paying a balance that was not disclosed. I disconnected the call from the first agent which lasted about 15 minutes.",0
I was on the phone with TD Bank WHILE the charge occurred. An email was sent at XXXX XXXX that day that the phone number for security had been changed on my account. I found it at the end of the work day and called them at XXXX XXXX.,0
Today I reached out trying to do just that but was put through a second verification.,0
being told that the recurring linkages will last for 3 months or more,0
- Chase recharged the {$590.00} to my account on XX/XX/XXXX,0
I had to call Chase and I had to call XXXX to get my credit cleared and locked.,0
Due to these faulty facts in the investigation,0
I XXXX DISCOVER CARD!!!,0
On XX/XX/2023 I received a letter stating their investigation was completed saying their investigation was completed saying they reviewed available information which confirmsI authorized the charge,0
This new card has no expiration date,0
Restore my previous Thank you rewards of XXXX Thank You points.,0
I did not deny that I purchased the goods. What I am Trying to explain to Discover is that the goods is no good.,0
1. ) Capital One 's 2-factor authentication does no authentication if the security token can be sent to ANY phone number,0
Immediately,0
I have questions about this : XXXX ) How many rewards have been issued since XXXX of this year?,0
Only reason I applied for the XXXX card was to get a head start with the Promo Bonus!,0
I have been an Amex member for over 16 years without issue prior,0
9. Apparently,0
-- XX/XX/XXXX Cit VISA requested additional information ( all of which I had already provided in the detailed documentation ). I started working on making the additional information more clear.,0
Tried calling numerous times and was bounced around from dept to dept.,0
In XXXX of XXXX during covid,0
I was in finance for many year and can only compare what he did to canceling a clients life insurance policy because I didnt agree with how that client invested their IRA account.,0
My repayment savings account has more than enough funds,0
So I opted to send the card to my po box,0
Had I known about the back interest during the interest-free period,0
( 9 ) The second day after arriving in XXXX my phone was compromised. ( hacked ) ( 10 ) XXXX had to closed my account down. ( 11 ) I was left without a phone which had all my apps and Bill pay on it. ( 12 ) No phone service frozen bank account I was unable to pay discovery for XXXX and was unable to reach then using my sister XXXX phone account as the toll free number did not work from the island.we tried the website information but was unsuccessful. ( 1 ) As soon as I returned to XXXX I contacted DiscoverXXXX and made my payment. They were very understanding and eventually removed the XXXX XXXX late fees that was charged.,0
XX/XX/23 : I faxed/emailed/mailed via XXXX a letter detailing the fraudulent transaction to CapitalOne.,0
Three major things at play here - 1 ) I was able to transfer points in and out of the account as recently as XX/XX/XXXX and XX/XX/XXXX,0
Next thing I know I tried to use the card and it was rejected. I called Citi and was told their policy is to close an account that has missed two payments. I was working with them on this the whole time and it was their service that wasnt working. I voiced how outrageous this was and asked for my account status to be reviewed and reopened. Just received an email this last week indicating they will not reopen the account.,0
To # 4,0
I was arrogantly told to leave the office and that if I did not leave the office they would call the police to get me trespassed.,0
I have been a loyal customer for many years and have consistently utilized the 0 % interest rate special offered by the Bandsmart card. However,0
Upon contacting XXXX 's card services,0
We also noticed that our credit score was lowered during this time as it seems Truist reported this to the credit bureaus which I believe is violating the Fair Credit Billing Act on disputed charges.,0
This is for XXXX dollars!,0
They are effectively holding my money hostage without providing me my credit on my account for my payment. I believe they are in violation of their terms of service. Please help me.,0
We had possesion of the card ending in XXXX,0
Today I spoke to XXXX ID XXXX in your department. We reviewed the above letter. I asked again for the specific written results,0
This XXXX XXXXXXXX,0
3 ) Access to the online payment system is cumbersome and slow. The online payment system is overly complicated,0
Every new card they issued kept being updated on a digital wallet which Citibank admitted they were having issues unlinking from their end. Every rep and supervisor said the same thing.,0
I therefore asked for the card closure to be removed because of the Amex error in not disclosing and they have yet to remove the card closure from my report.,0
The claim was initially refused by XXXX due to the amount of time that had passed from the purchase date but a simple further review will show that the purchase date is irrelevant in this matter as we were unaware the couch would not be delivered until the expected delivery date ( XXXX weeks ) had passed. As you can see from the attached purchase receipt that expected delivery timeframe was XXXX weeks AFTER the purchase date.,0
2. A charge I disputed in the amount of {$2200.00} was closed. I never received a letter stating this dispute was closed. I provided proof to AMEX but the airline claimed they offered me {$50.00} voucher to sit for 24 hours and I accepted and took the flight. As improbable as this sounds,0
Anyways here Im again with another completely unbelievable story of incompetence and ignorance. After the company redirected my own complaint back to me,0
2 ) Violation of Contractual obligation.,0
Given the facts I have stated above,0
I am still paying off the balance on the old,0
She let me know that the manager was available XXXX Monday to Friday. I am a full-time employee with a long daily commute,0
They demand I pay the whole statment amount that is outdated. Statment is XXXX dollars,0
It involves over {$500.00}.,0
Care Credit reported to the credit bureaus they THEY closed my account. That is a LIE. I closed it under their false pretenses. They also never disclosed Id be paying interest still. I just noticed yesterday Im still paying interest. They made it seem like Id pay {$150.00} until my account is paid off.,0
5. I need a copy of the ON and OFF PUBLIC and PRIVATE side of the Ledger for all accounting and transactions made. I need to make sure the accounting for the history of the account from the first day I signed the application ( which is the Receipts of FUNDS accessed and makes this purchase for my personal and family use PAID IN FULL ). I am the consumer and I am the creator of the Credit for my Legal Fiction Name for said account : XXXX XXXX. I am the Agent/ Beneficiary to this account and I am the ONLY living man that can Consent for every and all transactions for the account. If they can not provide me with certified copies of the consent letters for the Permissible Purpose,0
I filed a fraud report with XXXX Fleetcor  Mastercard but I havent heard back,0
Options to pay {$1800.00} were explicitly made to pay new balance and would not be applied to future Flex Payments. Copied from screenshot - that option specifically states : {$1800.00} - Remaining Adjusted New Balance + Flex Plan Monthly Payment This is the remaining amount owed to satisfy your monthly Flex Plan Payment Amount and the non-Flex Plan portion of your last statement balance. It does not include Flex Plan payments due in future months.,0
If Synchrony Bank made this condition known,0
I inquired about this on XXXX when I got back into the country I was told that the bank would not have promised me to cancel the card if it was to charge the fee again.,0
I perused my recent statement and discovered : 1. A credit promised me in the amount of {$1600.00} is not reflected on my transaction. During the course of the dispute,0
How could Capitalaones investigation be valid when they investigated wrong transactions?,0
CB/BF has informed me they have closed the dispute without resolving the lost payment issue,0
I value my relationship with Navy Federal Credit Union and want to ensure that all credit-related matters are handled fairly and in accordance with applicable laws and regulations. I am open to discussing this matter further and finding a resolution that aligns with the legal requirements.,0
- Purchase was made on XX/XX/XXXX,0
Bank of America called me after that complaint and explained that I should have had XXXX points leftover since the purchase I made used only XXXX points. They also told me to call the XXXX XXXX to get XXXX points added to my account as a compensation for the confusion. Ive called the XXXX XXXX and they have not credited back the points they deducted nor added the XXXX points. They refused to acknowledge that a mistake was made.,0
Hi XXXX,0
The AC company offered interest free financing through Wells Fargo. I am careful about my credit and have high fico scores,0
After a few days I found that the XXXX were still extremely uncomfortable and that everything I tried to consume,0
Bank of America attempted to increase my credit limit automatically which it did by {$17000.00}. This was insufficient and Kia filed a second request which has not been acted upon yet. Besides having {$29000.00} in cash sitting at the credit card company,0
I am not a detective. I was literally not present at these locations. I have had this card for years with no issues.,0
In the most recent call they now changed their story saying they now instead DO charge interest,0
I now have your XXXX account card ending in XXXX. What I noticed on this account is though you haven't used this,0
"XXXX statement : The \\\" Amount to avoid Standard and Deferred Interest '' is XXXX. No special offers ending. Paid XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX.",0
In light of the aforementioned circumstances,0
Then they stated they sent the card to my home address but via my application and my chat messages which I have screenshots of I explained to them,0
To my dismay I was told it would be a minimum of 60 days to resolve. That is ridiculous and here is why : When purchasing the machine,0
XXXX ) I considered fraudsters a legitimate business and that is why I gave them my credit card number just like I would do that to any other business when I do online shopping. I couldnt be held liable for that. I am the innocent victim.,0
I trust that the Federal Trade Commission will treat this complaint with the seriousness it deserves and take appropriate actions to ensure that consumers are not misled by deceptive marketing practices. I anticipate your response within a reasonable timeframe.,0
For this amount,0
XX/XX/ statement,0
The creditor is obligated to correct the billing error and credit my account with any disputed amount and related finance or other charges,0
Prior to removal,0
Date of Second ContacXXXX : XXXX Synopsis of Second Contact : Provided additional evidence including but not limited to merchant 's stated intent to liquidate returned merchandise without refunding consumer. Comenity responded on XX/XX/2023 referring to a past credit predating the actual purchase of the merchandise subject to the dispute as having somehow satisfied this refund request.,0
By law,0
Thanks for patiently waiting. I need to ask for you for one more favor. In order for me be able to completely remove the e-mail from the receiving these account alerts,0
I called back on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  and made a payment by phone for {$220.00} and I called the bank to stop payment ( however,0
I appreciate your immediate attention to this matter and expect a timely resolution. You may reach me at [ XXXX ] or [ XXXX if you require any further information.,0
XXXX XXXX - Disconnected- did not call back XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX spoken to an examiner XXXX claim escalted on hole for XXXX min. Told XXXX claim submitted twice for final approval.,0
Please take notice that my funds were transferred through means of coercion and under false pretenses all along!,0
After over four hours on the phone,0
4 ) The credit application is discriminatory in nature where they showcase income but do not recognize the income as if it pertains to a person receiving government assistance income or like SSA income. I believe other credit cards require you to disclose employment status or government assistance program supplying income and this application is quite generic and did not allow understandings of where the income is coming from.,0
Account 2 : XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX Paid in Full,0
What a pathetic display of XXXX from AMEX!!,0
He claims that the credit card was also physically used at XXXX XXXX via contactless payment. How is this possible when the card was physically being used at XXXX XXXX  at the same exact time? Even the fraud manager was perplexed. We could not have been at two different places at the same time.,0
All associates are helping other customers Your vendor name may not be the same as the business charging you. Check the date for what you might have purchased. As a retired CPA I track EVERYTHING but most don't have my experience nor time to figure this out.,0
This is absolutely ridiculous.,0
I have contacted Bank of Americas fraud prevention department but they couldnt explain why they locked the account except saying that it was system action There is no Bank of America branch near me. The nearest one is XXXX miles away from my home and I dont have a car.,0
Despite multiple attempts to communicate with their customer support team via email,0
Initially they refuse to tell me why my account was blocked again until they finally confess that someone made a mistake and didnt document things properly that I was identified with XXXX forms of ID.,0
Given the circumstances outlined above,0
"Then DO NOT click on the card ID or the \\\" Details ''",0
The mattress that I was replacing was 20 years old with no issues. I reported this to Mattress Firm and first of all was told that I had bought that at the outlet store. The store in XXXX XXXX IL on XXXX and XXXX XXXX nowhere does it state that it's an outlet store.,0
This situation has left me feeling not only frustrated but also concerned about my financial security and the protection of my personal information. The lack of transparency and information provided by Apple Card regarding the reasons for the card restriction is deeply troubling. It leaves customers like me in the dark and without proper knowledge of why our cards have been restricted,0
XX/XX/2023 i called to make sure the payment would go through,0
After I sent the email asking for proof of no access,0
XXXX Called Chase Execitve office XXXX XXXX said send email to XXXX with XXXX Supervisor XXXX called back -Missed call - She left msg to call back XXXX x XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX Disconnected XXXX called back XXXX holding for over XXXX min for him to come back after asking me to hold.,0
I called to follow up on XX/XX/XXXX and was told that the disputes were not reopened on XX/XX/XXXX. On the call on XX/XX/XXXX,0
I reported fraud last month,0
I connected BofA via XXXX and got a direct number for the fraud department. Then closed the unapproved account. Then I asked for what info was used to apply for the account. They told me they will send me a form to get that.,0
At this point Im confident theyre never going to ship so I request a refund. They approve the refund said it would arrive 7 business days. I forgot about it and then a month or so later realized the refund never came through.,0
The total was {$14000.00} At XXXX XXXX,0
When I mentioned to the rep I spoke with that it was a business account I paid from,0
( Please reference Exhibit XXXX ) At XXXX ( XXXX  ) XXXX sent Consumer a second follow up email indicating that the order XXXX had shipped and that package will arrive tomorrow ( XXXX ).,0
XXXX I call XXXX back to give them an opportunity to correct it ; the kind and unfortunate supervisor tells me that by their rules Discover can not do ANYTHING FOR ME~! I have to reach out to XXXX. He was upset as well,0
On the flight before departure I received a call that XXXX XXXX forgot to book the Business meal and as compensation they will provide me XXXX usd on the mode of payment at the counter at check in instead of money they have a letter saying XXXX will be given by XXXX XXXX after the flight I have contacted them several times to that I do not need points and it was agreed that they will credit my original mode of payment as I do not have an account and don't want it.,0

I did setup automatic payment from my bank checking account to pay this TD Bank card as soon as i received my first payment and never defaulted on this. Loan amount is XXXX XXXXXXXX XXXX,0
I believe that this is a fraud to get at least one late payment fee from new CC customers.,0
For them to refuse to resolve these charges ( approx {$7000.00} ) and demand that I investigate on my own is not proper for a credit card company that I trust to do the bare minimum in protecting me from obvious fraud.,0
I can not be expected to go investigate this myself. They say the credit card was present at these transactions. Well maybe someone stole the card from my mailbox? I have no idea - but a huge credit card company ( Capital One ) should not be telling me to do my own investigating. They should refund me and then go about retrieving the funds themselves. They are a XXXX dollar organization. I have work and responsibilities to attend to. They need to give me my money back.,0
I value the relationship I have with Bandsmart and Sinchrony bank,0
Citibank offered a Promotional rate of XXXX XXXX XXXX expiring XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  In XX/XX/XXXX,0
I understand that Chase 's promotion fine print states that the merchant code must be a utility company merchant code. However,0
I have contacted both XXXX XXXX XXXX and Citi Card numerous times today with no results. Both are pointing the finger at each other.,0
I recently ordered a new credit card.,0
I want my account restored so I do not loose my rewards points. They want to steal my rewards points by cancelling the account.,0
Somebody help me!,0
4. I called and emailed Ashley numerous times with little results. Ashley promised to refund the {$700.00} and pay for the dumpster but never did. Here are some of Ashley 's communications : A. XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXXXXXX ** Hello XXXX,0
XXXX ) The XXXX cause of this fraud was that Capitalone accepted 3rd party payments from fraudsters without any validation who used Fake bank accounts to make payments which consequently resulted in return of payments. To prove my point,0
Wells Fargo has a history of screwups they've REFUSED to resolve - the last one involved 2 different HOAs for 2 DIFFERENT residences in 2 DIFFERENT cities ( the 2 different HOAs may have used the same bank ).,0
I WANT HIM OFF PERIOD! This should have happened XX/XX/XXXX! BUT NO,0
Within 1 week of noticing the fraudulent charges,0
That makes no sense to hold the money at the bank 8 days after receiving to then apply it. To then say I have to wait 15 after that to receive something saying the debt was taken care of.,0
Synchrony offered no satisfaction or compensation when contacted via on-line chat. It was only during the chat that I discovered the reason for the missing 5 % cash back.,0
Specifically,0
Thank you!,0
On XXXX of my many phone calls to citi they stated that the payment was sent to an account ending in XXXX ... .my card ends in XXXX I was promised repeatedly that it had already been fixed and that I would see a credit and to wait for it to hit my account... ..it has not.,0

After I listened to the information from the XXXX meeting,0
This shipping was an urgent package and the teller said that they would deliver the package in 3-5 business days at the most.,0
The sale of a payment intangible often functions as a financing transaction. Revised Article 9 brings certainty to these transactions by bringing the sale of a payment intangible into the scope of Article 9. However,0
When I checked my XXXX XXXX XXXX account,0
"XXXX statement : The amount to \\\" Amount to avoid Standard and Deferred Interest '' by XX/XX/XXXX was XXXX ; I paid XXXX on XX/XX/XXXX. Interest was charged despite payment.",0
On XX/XX/XXXX. XXXX  I noticed two inquiries from Truist bank. I contacted Truist and informed them that I did not authorize two inquiries. I never received any written decision regarding the application.,0
After I got approval I visited the American Express to submit my balance transfer request. When I entered my XXXX credit card information it returned an error code. I called American Express about the issue and after some troubleshooting they were unable to enter it as well and I was told they will escalate and reach back within 4 weeks. After the 4 weeks passed I did not hear back so I called again and the representative seemed dumbfounded and did not understand that this is an ongoing issue and I was calling for a status update and treated it like it was my first time calling. They had me go through the troubleshooting yet again even though I stated I already did that and eventually said they will look into it and reach back in 4 weeks with a solution. I explained that I had already gone through this process and asked if I can speak to someone else,0
I called immediately to credit card customer service within XXXX minutes of this website navigation error. I was told that this can not be reversed.,0
I never received the card,0

I contacted Citibank Best Buy to request the activation of the Enhanced Debt Protection Program that I had been consistently paying for and purchased on XX/XX/XXXX.,0
When we get the approval,0
When we refused to pay disputed fraudulent charges to our account,0
On XX/XX/XXXX  I received another letter stating that based on their investigation this was a legitimate purchase and that I was still liable to pay for this unauthorized purchase. On XX/XX/XXXX  I called Ally and talked to XXXX at Ally card services disputing this charge as fraud once again. The amount was placed on hold on XX/XX/XXXX  while they conducted their investigation. The fact that this is the second time this particular credit card has been frauded leaves me to believe this is internal fraud. On XX/XX/XXXX  I received a letter once again stating that the company did not believe the purchase was fraudulent and that if I did not pay it they would report the purchase to all three credit agencies and turn me over to collections.,0
I dont know why Bank of America Credit Card Services wont honor that your company made an error and instead of resolving the issue of issuing a refund you basically XXXX over the customer me and in the meantime either follow through with the structural counseling or have that persons supervisor advise that employee that you told a long time Bank of America customer a lie.,0
I called customer service and spoke to XXXX ( XXXX XXXX ) and her supervisor XXXX  ( XXXX  XXXX ). Neither was able to complete my information update. The landline associated with the account has been terminated and I needed to update it with my cell phone number. When attempting to complete the authentication process neither of the XXXX  cell phone numbers I gave them were accepted. They would not use any other type of authentication process other than a scanned photo of my government issued I.D . sent across the internet. This is supposed to be for my security,0
XXXX received credit card with preferred annual fee membership. I checked balance to see if they charged me,0
How can CapitalOne unilaterally restrict my credit card when their customer service office is not open 24 hours and they do not offer any way for customers to remove holds online? What if I was traveling abroad and in an emergency and needed access to my account?,0
I then received my bill ending XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  indicating my original payment was posted by you on XX/XX/XXXXXXXX  and charging me a {$30.00} late fee.,0
I been disputing these charges since XXXX XXXX. T.D. respond is that they have reviewed the credit card dispute claim,0
I walked the approximately XXXX XXXX back to the empty terminal where I saw my wife,0

This charge was for nearly over half my original balance.,0
The cost was {$2400.00} for the casket. Capital One gave me a credit on XX/XX/XXXX bit then charged it back again on XXXX. I told them that I wanted to dispute the charge again and they said that the case was already closed and there was nothing they could do.,0
The Wells account currently has a {$6200.00} balance on it and the account still reports closed.,0

I will attach copies of my credit reports behind junior and other agencies that report credit histories. I am applying for a credit card and consider that I qualify to have it. I also consider that I am being a victim of injustice and discrimination when it comes to receiving a decision. In my credit history you can see that my credit does not have negative information. I only have a few credit cards with a low credit limit for which I am applying for the Apple card so that my credit limit can grow.,0

Today I called them and talked to manager XXXX. I asked for the {$40.00} late fees to be removed off my bills. She told me that the {$29.00} was not the correct minimum payment ( even though it appeared on my XXXX bill ) because it did not include additional fees. She also told me that the interest rate was 29 %.,0
Violation of Consumer Rights : Capital One 's actions seem to be in direct violation of the XXXX and XXXX,0
Should you have any questions regarding this Bonus Points Offer you received,0
The purchase and credit amounts should be settled within the same month. Applying a credit issued in XXXX to a previous statement balance is strange and unusual because the credit does not represent an actual payment received by Wells Fargo from my bank.,0
XX/XX/XXXX I settled and paid an Additional {$4400.00} to an already closed account via online payment XX/XX/XXXX I spoke with collections department about these issues told me to call back in 3 days.,0
Only a portion of the funds were refunded and what was basically done was they charged me two times for the same service. I have asked that the balance of {$2200.00} that they retained be refunded but they have failed to. Instead they recently billed me for it indicating that to be the resolution to my dispute. This eerily borders on fraud.,0
The {$1000.00} is merely a numerical transaction affecting the total amount owed for a specific month.,0

-- Key Issues : Failure to Conduct a Comprehensive Investigation : Capital One failed to adequately investigate the situation,0
"XXXX the SUPERVISOR came on finally and stated she was the one who had given XXXX the case number AND the tracking number for my replacement cards. She had been \\\" coaching her in the background. '' No empathy. No apology for the delay and ATROCIOUS customer service. And absolutely No understanding of customer inconvenience! WOW.",0
If you haven't already done so,0
"NEITHER the case number or tracking numbers provided were valid. The tracking number went to NO major carrier ; and no where on Macy 's site for a \\\" case number '' And as of this writing STILL have received no replacement credit card.",0
I went to make a payment online. The site repeatedly refused my checking account. I finally had to resort to my husband 's account. Then it still would not accept the bank account. Only until I went through the process of setting up auto debit. Which we are against. We got defrauded before.,0
At this moment,0
PayPal An update on case XXXX The investigation into your appeal regarding the transaction below is complete and this case has been found in your favor.,0
Thank you for your immediate attention to this formal complaint. I look forward to a prompt resolution.,0
First,0
I contacted the credit bank Apple Card is a credit card created by Apple INC and issued by Goldman Sachs Apple and a manager responded to me informing me that the only way they can reconsider my application is for XXXX to confirm that there is incorrect information on the card. decision. I contacted XXXX again and they do not have a letter format to send Goldman Sachs Apple bank the rectification that there is incorrect information in the decision of my Apple credit card application and that there are no negative accounts in my credit history. Only they can give me a copy of my credit record,0
XX/XX/2023 I requested a replacement card when I realized my current card had expired XXXX ; and had not received a replacement card. I was told a replacement card would be sent out right a way and to expect in 7-10 business days. I am unable to locate first individual 's name I spoke with- or time called.,0
HOW does that work? Does a company just not send you the card and your account just sits there with available credit but the customer never uses it because they never receive a credit card?,0
XXXX. Copy of my report from XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX.,0
The representative for XXXX XXXX convinced us to join their organization. They promised my children a trip to XXXX,0
XXXX ) I called customer service around XX/XX/XXXX to attempt to make the transfer via phone. The agent indicated that the problem is that AmEx system can not fit my full legal name,0
If you wish to no longer receive these types of marketing offers in the future,0
Eventually I would get Late notices in my email.,0
"XX/XX/2023 @ XXXX I called to check on the replacement credit card that still had not been received. Of course this is also a safety issue! I spoke with XXXX. XXXX confirmed the call of XXXX ; and also confirmed that the replacement credit card had \\\" NEVER BEEN MAILED '' from my call made on XXXX ; and \\\" there was a mail issue. '' He promised to get it mailed out as soon as possible- even promising to \\\" Overnight '' the card due to the delay- no card- no communications- no nothing. XXXX stated I should receive the replacement card from 24 to 48 hrs. and to be on the look out for it.",0
I would do that.,0
I am humbly requesting the agency to assume jurisdiction,0
THIS IS INSANE!,0
The bank stated the following reasons for closing my account : - Too Many Revolving Accounts With High Balance Compared to Credit Limit - Not Enough Balance Paid Down Over Time On Real Estate Secured Loans - Too Many Inquiries - Ratio of Non-Real Estate Loan Balances to Balances On Real Estate Secured Loans Is Too High These reasons are incorrect and unsubstantiated : 1. All my cards combined are using only 35 % of my total limit,0
I demand that Synchrony Bank provide evidence for each stated reason for the account closure. The action taken against me is unfair and takes undue advantage of my recent life changes,0
Allegation of Discrimination I have observed that people with less favorable credit profiles than mine have been approved for the same credit card. This leads me to ask if I am being discriminated against for unknown and unstated reasons.,0
-- Interaction with Capital One Immediately after my conversation with XXXX,0
When I received my statement there were two charges for {$190.00} from the XXXX XXXX. I talked to XXXX at Citi on XX/XX/XXXX at XXXX XXXX  He said because I was a valued customer he would remove {$180.00} When I called next morning to pay my {$710.00} Citi bill the {$180.00} had not been removed Also XXXX said he had emailed me a letter about protesting the second XXXX {$190.00} charge as I had not received the original letter sent to me. From XXXX XXXX  on XX/XX/XXXX I talked with three or four reps from XXXX and XXXX until XXXX XXXX  mostly waiting on hold..,0
Today in this letter I will detail step by step the unfair process that they have done towards me. It is not the only Bank that has been unfair to me and I have already reported it previously and thanks to the fact that I have reported it this way,0
U.S. Bank provided me with the signatures from the product delivery for the XX/XX/2023 and XX/XX/2023 transactions,0
I am at a loss as to what to do. I am a widowed XXXX  citizen an am desperate for your help.,0
Problem XXXX : Third Party Supplemental Information ( XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ) Goldman Sachs also based its decision on additional information from a third party XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX XXXX ),0
After multiple attempts,0
2. I have had the same real estate loan for over 15 years and have never been late on a payment. This loan was in place at the time I was approved for my Sam 's Club Card.,0
On XX/XX/XXXX I then received notice that my dispute had been denied and requested further information of the decision. I recieved no information even after this point. I then requested another appeal with further information regarding the goods not being received.,0
Now Synchrony Bank has place an item on my account so it would show late. I did not owe this balance case the told me they would not report it as being late due to the fact my husband had the information and his e-mail was attached to the account. I was not aware that he has his e-mail on the account.,0
After not hearing back from them for months,0

It was not use to us because the it was malfunctioning and the important features that my son wanted was working.,0

now I am way behind,0
15 USC 1681 Section 604 A Section 2 : It also state a consumer reporting agency can not furnish an account without written instructions.,0
I participated in a three-way call with XXXX and Capital One,0
While we investigate whether or not there has been an error,0
I am thanking you in advance for any help you can give me.,0
Discover did not alert me of this charge nor did it trigger their fraud alerts when these XXXX ( XXXX ) transactions were not only large but doubled.,0
I received a bill for XX/XX/2023 stating that I my account was overdue for the amount of {$36.00} ( total amount due for merchandise purchased ) plus a late fee of {$28.00}. The due date had been XX/XX/2023. However,0
Despite providing all the relevant facts,0
3 ) Earn XXXX points Make any 5 digital wallet transactions* with your credit card before XX/XX/2023 and the XXXX points are yours.,0
Today I logged into my account to increase the payments to pay it off as I have the cash now. I see that each month they have added a {$40.00} late fee to my account even though I paid the minimum amount they informed me on my bill in XXXX by the due date each month since then.,0
Id make a payment through that... never having an account set up,0
While you do not have to pay the amount in question,0
I am deeply disappointed by this lack of transparency and failure to uphold the terms of the welcome offer,0
Ignoring Documentation and Third-Party Confirmation : Even after a three-way call with XXXX,0
Previous complaint was CFPB # XXXX XXXX did not respond to the substance of the previous complaint.,0
Called them the following day twice. They claim they couldn't authenticate me after i answered all their questions. Told me to go to a branch or go online and rudly hung up on me so I called back. The 2nd person was a better experience but the authentication questions wouldn't populate. Told me to call back later on in the week. Didn't seem all that sure if a manager could help in my case. Their aware there's no branch near me.,0
I was alerted of XXXX charges at once via text ( XXXX ) I replied XXXX denying the charges {$170.00} a XXXX XXXX Over {$6400.00} at Dal Tile And a approved charge,0
I filed a police report,0
XXXX I noticed XXXX and XXXX had been charged interest,0
On XX/XX/XXXX I applied for a credit card Apple Card is a credit card created by Apple INC and issued by Goldman Sachs. My application was denied because Goldman Sachs Apple tells me in the application decision that my XXXX XXXX credit bureau tells them I have a recently closed CHECKING/SAVINGS ACCOUNT. I contacted the company XXXX and a manager informs me that in my credit history it does not appear that I recently had a SAVINGS BANK ACCOUNT OR RECENTLY CLOSED CHECK,0
In the end,0
I hired a lawyer to try and get more information from them on my account. They refused to talk to him,0
2 ) Make payments on the go Just hold your phone up to the payment terminal at the store or use your digital wallet to make purchases in-app and online.,0
HOW much money does Macy 's LOSE NOT sending customers out their replacement credit cards out timely or at all? That's just ridiculous!!,0

The {$1000.00} credit can not be applied anywhere until the {$1000.00} transaction is paid,0
At no time did I receive a letter in the mail from the company that anything was late. Synchrony Bank have a history of over charging people for items that was not on the account. I feel like this bank has falsely reported information to the credit company. I have neve been late on this account for over 7 years. I paid the balance in full and they told me from HSN account had been paid.,0

Subsequent statements from Comenity continued to rack up late fees and interest charges while I waited for a conclusion to the investigation.,0
I want these fees refunded. I also question whether your agency is going its job to allow a 29 % interest rate on credit cards.,0
Thank you for your consideration of this matter.,0
